White's beloved novel, this Disney-fied version chronicles the tutoring of the Once and Future King, Arthur, as handled by the magician Merlin. Sword was a portent of things to come, with slapstick upbraiding storytelling, and cultural in-jokes substituting for wonder. But there's much to enjoy here as Merlin shows Newt, the young Arthur, things that will help him become the ruler of the Britons. The transformation sequences, where the boy is turned into a fish, a bird, and a squirrel are vintage Disney.

Sethe and Denver take her in and then strange things begin to happen. Set in rural Ohio several years after the Civil War, this profoundly affecting chronicle of slavery and its aftermath is Toni Morrison's greatest novel, a dazzling achievement, and the most spellbinding reading experience of the decade. A brutally powerful, mesmerizing story- read it and tremble. At the center of Toni Morrison's fifth novel, which earned her the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, is an almost unspeakable act of horror and heroism: a woman brutally kills her infant daughter rather than allow her to be enslaved. The woman is Sethe, and the novel traces her journey from slavery to freedom during and immediately following the Civil War. Woven into this circular, mesmerizing narrative are the horrible truths of Sethe's past: the incredible cruelties she endured as a slave, and the hardships she suffered in her journey north to freedom. Just as Sethe finds the past too painful to remember, and the future just ""a matter of keeping the past at bay,"" her story is almost too painful to read. Yet Morrison manages to imbue the wreckage of her characters' lives with compassion, humanity, and humor.

Her grandfather, Jonathan Carrick, was a white man. He was sold just after the Civil War to a struggling Kansas tobacco farmer - a common enough practice in those days when black slaves were no longer legal and the children of destitute soldiers were being marketed. You could pick up a white kid cheap, and Jonathan, only four years old, went for fifteen dollars. Woven together from his coded diaries and from memories of the embittered family, the harrowing story that emerges is that of a child denied his past, ""bound out"" to a brutish man (whose justification is ""You get you an animal, you got to break him""), trussed and staked to the floor of the sod hut to keep him from running away, worked endlessly at planting, harvesting, picking off tobacco worms by hand, wrapping tobacco plugs (while the other children go to school), and - the ultimate humiliation - bullied by the soft, resentful son of the family, George Stoke. Through it all the anger burns, yet the fire forges an uncanny strength in the child. He bides his time. And then the railroad roars through the prairie, stopping at Sweetbrier, Kansas, and provides escape - freedom in the rough boomtown of Denver and a ferociously dangerous career as brakeman, astride the cars on the TransContinental Mogul heading into the Rockies. In the railroad yards, College, a gabby fellow runaway of sorts, befriends the helpless young man; in a bar in Cheyenne a fire-and-brimstone preacher fights for his soul; in a windswept farmhouse in Maine he finally gets the education that had been withheld. Jonathan survives - survives his ""idyll with God,"" his education, his uneasy marriage. But the rage keeps breaking through, and always it is George Stoke, now a fat ""cobra of a politician,"" known as the ""fearless liberal"" senator from Kansas, who is the target. The strategies of war - fueled by hatred - are what keep Jonathan Carrick in fighting trim.

Ben learns that the man was not really his father, and sets out for Ireland to learn the truth about his family and his past. His odyssey thrusts him into the middle of a bloody struggle between soldiers of the newly formed Irish Republican Army and savage British troops known as the Black and Tans.

A Question of Proof is a spell-binding and profoundly moving courtroom drama in which a lawyer struggles to defend the woman he loves against the accusation that she murdered her husband. Tough and street-smart, a principled rebel against an establishment he has always scorned, Dan Lazar has risen from the working class to become one of Philadelphia's top criminal defenders. But now divorced and badly missing his young son, disillusioned by years of representing vicious criminals, humiliated by the politically ambitious DA's charge that he bribed a witness in a brutal rape-homicide case, Dan is burned out, depressed, and ready to call it quits. On the surface he would seem to have nothing in common with Susan Boelter, the beautiful and patrician wife of Peter Boelter, who runs the city's dominant newspaper and heads one of its most powerful families. But when Peter deserts her and files for divorce, moving to seize everything that is precious to her, including custody of their thirteen-year-old daughter, Susan turns to a reluctant Dan for help. Suddenly, Peter is found dead. Susan becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Driven by his love for her and by an inner need to defend someone in whose innocence he can truly believe, Dan starts to investigate. He soon discovers a maze of conflicting evidence and of growing doubts and mystery about the woman he thought he knew and loved. And he realizes that the truth he desperately seeks - especially about Peter Boelter's death - depends on finding the answer to a question of proof. From Philadelphia's courtrooms in City Center to the mansions in its moneyed suburbs, A Question of Proof is the gripping story of one man's internal battle between love and justice and the lengths to which a wealthy family will go to hide its secrets.",1993,DET,,,rh_1308,Ficciones,"Borges, Jorge Luis",372,Random House,1993,469,"Stories deal with an unusual garden, an enormous library, authorship, language, memory, philosophy, and the art of writing.",1993,LIT,,,rh_1365,When They Took Away The Man In The Moon,"Lehrer, Kate",2174,Random House,1993,458,"When They Took Away the Man in the Moon is a powerful and provocative novel of self-discovery that explores the crystalline terrain of childhood memory, the tangle of family roots, and the unreasonable expectations we have for our very modern lives.

Born in Texas, tempered by Washington, and newly arrived on the Boston scene, she is also forty-five, twice divorced, and a closet romantic who cannot understand why love, not sex, continues to elude her. As she enters the critical phase of a campaign for a candidate who may not be all he appears to be, H.A. finds her career and her life on hold while she grapples with her mother's sudden stroke back in Texas.

In upstate New York, Frances Thorn waits tables in a diner, despite her privileged, educated background, and raises her twin daughters without the presence or even a memory of their father. But these puzzling circumstances are made stranger still, and inalterably changed, when she meets an elderly Danish woman named Helle Ten Brix, a renowned but esoteric composer now living with relatives in the same small town. At the heart of this peculiar friendship is a folktale, later retold by Hans Christian Andersen, about a prideful girl: rather than ruin her new shoes while crossing the treacherous bogs, she uses the loaf of bread intended as a present for her parents as a stepping-stone - only to be condemned for her arrogance to a horrible fate, trapped at the bottom of the bog forever. She is also the subject of Helle's final opera, left unfinished at her death and willed, along with the rest of her music, to Frances. From this curious legacy Frances must not only unravel the mysteries of the composer's life and work, but also confront the sorrow they have come to share.

As death approaches, life takes on, for some of these aging heroes, a translucence, a magical fragility; vivid memory and casual misperception lend the mundane an antic texture, and the backward view, lengthening, acquires a certain grandeur.

So begins E.L. Doctorow's astounding new novel of post-Civil War New York, where maimed veterans beg in the streets, newsboys fight for their corners, the Tweed Ring operates the city for its own profit, and a conspicuously self-satisfied class of new wealth and weak intellect is all a glitter in a setting of mass misery. As Pemberton tries in vain to track the strange omnibus of old men, he leads us into a city we know and recognize and yet don't know, a ghost city that stands to contemporary New York like a panoramic negative print, reversed in its lights and shadows, its seasons turned round. The increasingly ominous tale is narrated by Pemberton's sometime employer, McIlvaine, the editor of the newspaper for which the young man writes occasional reviews. When Pemberton himself disappears, McIlvaine goes in pursuit of the truth of his freelance's bizarre fate. Layer by layer, he reveals to us a New York more deadly, more creative, more of a genius society than it is now. New technologies transport water to its reservoirs and gaslight to its streetlamps. Locomotives thunder down its streets. Telegraphy sings in its overhead wires, and its high-speed printing presses turn out tens of thousands of newspapers for a penny or two. It is a proudly, heedlessly modern city, and yet ... the scene of ancient, primordial urges and transgressions, a companion city of our dreams ... a moral hologram generated from this celebrated author's electrifying historical imagination.

For Sarah, marriage was a destructive snare; she finds freedom in nature, reward in a wallpaper business she has created (so women can make rooms of their own), and sexual satisfaction with a man in his late sixties who understands her needs. Harriet is lost, no longer employed as a wife; to protect herself she gets a gun; to bolster herself, a young man's attention. A life-and-death crisis brings the two women together.

In the ship's hold are 2,348 pieces of a cast-iron church that has been designed by the great French engineer Gustave Eiffel - a monument to colonialism, and to the European faith in modernity, that Valence will assemble here in ""Lower California,"" on the fringes of empire. But neither Theo nor Suzanne is prepared for. The effect her beauty and clairvoyance will have on the town and its inhabitants - an effect far greater than the incongruous church itself. As her husband applies himself faithfully to his work, the insular French community weighs the charms and merits of her presence, which also (and innocently) excites the imagination of a flamboyant Mexican officer and an itinerant American prospector. Meanwhile these tensions are reflected by those inherent to such a hybrid place. Part European, part American and wholly apart from any world familiar to any of its inhabitants except the Indians whose labors account for its very existence. Part love story, part adventure, part mystery and part hallucination, Air & Fire is a magnificent tale of conflicting passions and cultures, set in a harsh and magical landscape where Parisian boulevards have been constructed in the dust, and where desires of all sorts exceed the opportunities of fulfillment. After the widely acclaimed Dreams of Leaving and The Five Gates of Hell, Rupert Thomson demonstrates yet again his extraordinary ability to merge real and invented landscapes into a transfixing world of his own, and furthers his position as one of England's most original and visionary new writers.

In this case, Kinsey agrees to do a favor for a friend of a friend and gets herself into so much trouble that she promises at the outset never to do such a thing again without careful consideration. Henry Pitt, her longtime landlord asks her to help a fellow neighbor find evidence that his grandfather served in the military during the Second World War. With such proof, the man can be decently buried, courtesy of the U.S. government. It seems such a simple thing, but with Kinsey, it rarely is. Before long she finds herself entangled with an eccentric and quarrelsome family as well as a long lost buddy who has turned up just in time to get himself beaten up in a robbery attempt of the alleged veteran's apartment. It seems there is a reason the Armed Services have no record of the dead man's service. Kinsey sets out to determine what he might have been doing instead of fighting against the Japanese and why someone might think his shabby apartment worth a burgle. Typical of the series, the mystery is not the central point of the story, but rather a starting point for Kinsey to become embroiled in a suspenseful (and delightful) search-and-rescue operation, usually against her better judgement. In this case, a gun-toting, arthritic octogenarian and revelations of the inner workings of bargain-rate motels are all part of the adventure.

Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love, always elusive, is scorned as illusion. Sayuri's story begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. Through her eyes, we see the decadent heart of Gion--the geisha district of Kyoto--with its marvelous teahouses and theaters, narrow back alleys, ornate temples, and artists' streets. And we witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it.

Years later Swagger married Donny's widow, Julie, and together they raise their daughter, Nikki, on a ranch in the isolated Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho. Although he struggles with the painful legacy of Vietnam, Swagger's greatest wish--to leave his violent past behind and live quietly with his family--seems to have come true.

Like Phillip Roth's American Pastoral or Don DeLillo's Underworld, Michael Chabon's The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is a superb novel with epic sweep, spanning continents and eras, a masterwork by one of America's finest writers. It is New York City in 1939. Joe Kavalier, a young artist who has also been trained in the art of Houdini-esque escape, has just pulled off his greatest feat to date: smuggling himself out of Nazi-occupied Prague. He is looking to make big money, fast, so that he can bring his family to freedom. His cousin, Brooklyn's own Sammy Clay, is looking for a collaborator to create the heroes, stories, and art for the latest novelty to hit the American dreamscape: the comic book. Out of their fantasies, fears, and dreams, Joe and Sammy weave the legend of that unforgettable champion the Escapist. And inspired by the beautiful and elusive Rosa Saks, a woman who will be linked to both men by powerful ties of desire, love, and shame, they create the otherworldly mistress of the night, Luna Moth. As the shadow of Hitler falls across Europe and the world, the Golden Age of comic books has begun. The brilliant writing that has led critics to compare Michael Chabon to John Cheever and Vladimir Nabokov is everywhere apparent in The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.

Everyone is ready to give up except Detective John Cardinal, an all-too-human loner whose persistence only serves to get him removed from homicide. Haunted by a criminal secret in his own past and hounded by a special investigation into corruption on the force (conducted, he suspects, by his own partner), Cardinal is on the brink of losing his career -- and his family. Then the mutilated body of thirteen-year-old Katie Pine is pulled out of an abandoned mineshaft. And only Cardinal is willing to consider the horrible truth: that this quiet town is home to the most vicious of serial killers. The case as it unfolds proves eerily reminiscent of the Moors murders in Britain, as an unassuming young man and his belligerently loyal girlfriend scout young victims for their macabre games. With the media, the provincial police and his own department questioning his every move, Cardinal follows increasingly tenuous threads towards the unthinkable. Time isn't only running out for him, but for another young victim, tied up in a basement wondering when and how his captors will kill him.
