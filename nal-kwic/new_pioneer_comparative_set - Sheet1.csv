With the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany during the 1930s and into the 1940s, there was deep concern among anthropologists in America and elsewhere about how to counter the racist assumptions fostered by Hitler and the Nazis. The distinguished anthropologist, Franz Boas, argued that there was no necessary relationship between race, language, and culture, as the Nazis and other racists claimed. Sapir's conclusions about California linguistics demonstrated that Boas's argument was correct—although the languages of Northwest California varied greatly, this linguistic variability was not correlated in any way with either the physical or cultural attributes of these Indians, which in fact were relatively uniform throughout the area. Thus the anthropology of Northwest California provided an effective reply to the Nazi claims to a superior Germanic race, language, and culture."

Dr. Carl Muschenheim, chairman of the Association's National Committee on Indian Health, in his statement before the House and Senate subcommittees on appropriations for the Department of Interior and related agencies, recommended: (1) An annual appropriation of $18 million to the Division of Indian Health of the United States Public Health Service for the construction of sanitation facilities in order that the existing backlog of unmet need be eliminated within a period of five to six years; and (2) An annual appropriation of $5 million to the DIH for field health services in support of the sanitation construction program.","Dr. Muschenheim commended the subcommittees on their pioneer action in bringing into being two community-oriented preventive mental health programs recommended by the Association in previous years, as well as a third one in the Southwest, and for initiating a recommended five-year comprehensive trachoma control program.

Into this region of international rivalry there was projected the buffer colony of Georgia. It is the purpose of this book to trace the part played by Georgia in this triangular rivalry of England, France and Spain and to make clear the role of the Indians in this conflict both as friends in trade and as allies or enemies in war. In the past twenty years, colonial Georgia and the neighboring region have attracted merited attention from scholars.","Nearly two decades ago, McCain wrote his Georgia as a proprietary province, a pioneer monograph which was soon followed by other works in the same field. Swanton's studies of the Creeks and other southern Indian tribes shed new light on the red men of the south. In 1925, Bolton and Ross published their stimulating book, The Debatable Land, which sketched the history of Spain's title to Georgia. The writings of Professor Bolton himself and of his students, especially Mary Ross and J. G. Johnson, have cast new light on the Spanish period of Georgia history. Coulter's articles in the Georgia Historical Quarterly and his scholarly A Short History of Georgia are of much value to the student of colonial Georgia affairs."

In the first part of this century, Albertans relied on passing reminiscences of pioneer settlers and hearsay accounts for depictions of life in ancient times. Beginning in the mid1930s, however, a succession of American professional archaeologists made periodic quests through the province. Dr. Junius Bird of the American Museum of Natural History, spent the greater part of the summer and fall of 1938 in Alberta, and visited many of the archaeological sites still considered to be of outstanding importance. In that same era Dr. Wes Bliss also spent some time in northern Alberta, and published his findings in a contemporary edition of Science.","In 1949, Boyd Wettlaufer, under the auspices of the University of New Mexico, initiated what might properly be viewed as the first systematic attempt to excavate an archaeological site in the province, and although his pioneering investigations at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump did not reach fruition, they certainly established a pattern for later, more successful projects. A rather dramatic change in this pattern of transient investigations was effected in 1955 and 1956 when the Glenbow Foundation of Calgary investigated the possibility of establishing an archaeological research and exhibition programme, utilizing the services of Dr. Marie Wormington, Dr. William Mulloy, and Dr. E. Mott Davis. In 1957 this effort was given additional impetus when Dr. Richard G. Forbis became the first resident professional archaeologist in the province, later to be appointed as Sessional Lecturer at the University of Calgary in 1961. His arrival heralded the beginnings of an ever-increasing pace of dedicated and systematic investigation of the prehistoric heritage of this province by local institutions, and provided one vital step in the progression which eventually resulted in the formation of the Archaeological Survey of Alberta. Other important stimuli were developing simultaneously in the private sector and educational fields."

Hurricane Hollow Site is located on the north bank of Hurricane Creek at its junction with Bryant River in the northeastern section of Ozark County, Missouri. The site is situated on a low mound approximately one quarter of an acre in extent which appears to be a very old remnant of an ancient river terrace. This terrace residual is at the mouth of Hurricane Hollow where the bluffs of the hollow open onto the present flood plain of Bryant River. The site is extremely well sheltered from all angles, and is ideally suited for prehistoric occupation.","A few fruit trees and chimney stones indicate that the locality was also utilized for a time by a pioneer settler of the region. A survey of the surface of the Hurricane Hollow Site indicates that considerable sheet erosion has occurred around the edges of the mound, and it is within this eroded section that most of the artifacts were found, indicating that the prehistoric area of occupation is probably buried beneath a layer of alluvial deposit. A number of surveys of the site were conducted in the spring of 1948 by the persons mentioned above and by Mr. Hutchinson, the discoverer of the site.

It is probable that this vast region was visited by Mexicans, and by Spaniards, possibly for mining purposes. Once the Navajos returned from Bosque Redondo they began making their own silver ornaments and they may have done some prospecting for the metal. In any event the Navajos did display quantities of silver jewelry, and it was easy for the hopeful prospector to conclude that they must have a secret source of silver, perhaps an Old Spanish mine.","Some such source as this was being sought by young James Merrick, who in 1879 visited the Mitchells, one of the pioneer families on the San Juan River living at the mouth of Montezuma Creek. Merrick asked Ernest Mitchell to accompany him as guide and the two searched the country south of the San Juan River for an ancient silver mine. In March, 1880, Navajo Indians killed the two men near the buttes named after them – 16 —"

Combinations offensive and defensive show great aptitude in statecraft as well as in the art of war.","The journeys made by the Prophet Elkswatawa, along the lakes, penetrating to the south as far as Alabama and the Carolinas and thence north through what is now Pennsylvania and New York, and which resulted in forming that great confederation of tribes against the white pioneer, was an achievement worthy of a statesman of the first order, and the ability displayed by his brother Tecumseh marked him as a military genius of great merit. The conspiracy of Pontiac in which he planned the attack and capture of nine out of eleven English military posts stretching from Fort Pitt, where now stands the city of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, to Detroit, Michigan,was a military achievementevincing greatability. In our own time, Sitting Bull, Looking-glass and Chief Joseph have exhibited similar abilities, while Spotted Tail, Red Cloud, Chief Joseph, Moses, Ouray and others have met in council many of the brightest politicians, statesmen, soldiers and lawyers sent out to represent our government, and, by reason, logic, argument and eloquence have proved a match for them in all but the force of numbers. This unequal contest has been going on for many generations between millions of white civilized people on the one side, and less than three hundred thousand natives on the other. Meantime, contemporaneous events have been enacted in other parts of the world which make the North American Indian stand forth by contrast as a marvel of patriotism, heroism, self-sacrifice and fortitude."

But the adventurous ones, the traders and trappers, flocked in to explore and exploit the new land. Lewis and Clark, returning from the Oregon coast in the fall of 1806, met boatloads of eager men some 1,500 miles up the Missouri from St. Louis, all of them pressing on to the wild country, with a special interest in furs. When they found that the Missouri region provided a rather scant supply of the standard furs, many of them turned their attention to buffalo robes and such by-products as fat and dried and smoked meats. Until the coming of the railroads, the only good approach to the buffalo country was through St. Louis and on up the Missouri."

But the officials would make no such promise. They wanted the boundary to work just one way, against the Indians, and they were both unwilling and unable to halt the westward push of their people. The border problem was complicated further when the smallpox scourge of 1837 finally reached the Comanche country."

Many different men over a period of 350 years had determined that the buffalo could not be domesticated, nor could it be successfully crossed with cattle. Buffalo had to be handled like animals in a zoo, and it would be difficult to get enough initial breeding stock from the open plains to stock the fenced ranges. .","— The first attempts to manage buffalo as domestic stock were made on the plains east of the Pecos River by pioneer settlers from the Rio Grande Valley who expected to become wealthy stockmen overnight, with their great herds fattening on the free grass of the Great Plains. They expected to choose their initial range stock from the immense herds of wild ""cattle,"" the cibolas, which, they reasoned, should need only to be corraled and supervised. A well-organized party of mounted men should be able to round up enough buffalo in one day to stock a large ranch, an initial herd of perhaps 10,000. In 1599 sixty men set out for the plains on just such a mission, and soon found the buffalo herds. Don Juan de Onate gave this account: Next day they went three more leagues in search of a convenient and suitable site for a corral, and on finding a place, they began to construct it out of large pieces of cotton wood."

Other artifacts from this period include leaf-shaped and notched spear points, and points with stems offset by square shoulders. There are burins, large thick scrapers, endscrapers, gravers, drills, and shaft Smoothers, all made of Stone.

Many of these implements from the southwest Mackenzie District are similar to the older tools of the Palaeo-Arctic tradition; others suggest contacts between Plains Archaic and Northern Archaic peoples. As Fisherman Lake is located just north of the Plains, it is not surprising that contact occurred. Far to the north, at Whirl Lake, located at the southern edge of the Mackenzie Delta, is another example of the hybrid microblade culture.

Not just the kinds of plants but the system of planting: the European style of intensive agriculture, particularly row-style plantation agriculture that the Spanish established everywhere, was the worst sort to introduce to a tropical ecosystem. It was done by plowing, which laid soil to waste far more severely than the Indians' planting stick and hoe; it used monocultural openfield planting, which exposed the surface soils to wind and water erosion far more drastically than the Tainos' careful conuco planting; and it required (along with fuel and shelter needs) the cutting and almost complete clearing of the heavy evergreen forests that were the stable, old-growth vegetation throughout the Caribbean.

Although women have been capable leaders in the running of clubs, involvement of women over the years in Western Icelandic voluntary associations has been subject to fluctuations. From the end of World War II until the late 1960's, women were not as active in clubs as they had been in the twenty years previously.

Then he received from one of the figures a large pipe and seated himself to complete our circle. The other watcher with a long white splinter lighted at the flame, held it to the pipe; and the Priest drew a long inspiration and then emitted from his lips a jet of smoke directly upward and another downward, then one to the right hand and another to the left, and passed the pipe to the next on his right, and so on it was handed around the circle, each person making the smoke take the same directions until the pipe was returned to the Priest. As the interpreter afterward explained, the first upward direction of the smoke was an act of recognition and submission made to Him whose name is never spoken, as the Father of all; the second direction, of recognition and dependence made to Earth, the Mother of all living things; and the directions to the right and left, a recognition of the brotherhood and mutual dependence of mankind. It did not escape my notice that it was in itself a sign of the cross.","I have seen thousands prostrate in silent submission to the uplifted Host in a cathedral and heard divine service in a pine forest with a reverent audience of pioneer families; I have heard the songs of Zion mingling with moaning billows on the ocean, and witnessed the efforts of all creeds and faiths to satisfy that inborn longing of every human heart to seek the Creator; but never have I paid more reverent attention to religious worship anywhere than to that of these children of memory in their estufa.

Even if the nature of history had not precluded a strictly scientific approach, Turner's enthusiasm for his subject matter and his patriotic pride in his country would have made him the wrong man to attempt the job.","“This progress of society from pioneer life on a seashore, to the colonization of successive sections, and to the final occupation of a continental empire,” he states, “is one of the most wonderful chapters in human history.” Since Turner's feelings lent a somewhat rosey hue to his discussion of the frontier and its inhabitants, it is hardly surprising that his frontier theory became widely known and widely accepted. Here was the new national history, the theoretical basis for understanding the American character. The special qualities of American democracy, it was felt, could be explained by the frontier experience and by the evolution of sections.

His belief that he had carried Chamberlin's method over to historical research was quite sincere; but, in fact, he seems to have confused the interdisciplinary, comparative method of investigation with the methodology of multiple working hypotheses.

Much had been written and discussed in support of this view and anyone who believed in the earlier existence of man in the Americas had their conclusions attacked and means of investigation discounted. It was only through the definite association of lithic artifacts with extinct forms of Pleistocene megafauna at the Folsom, Lindenmeier, and other sites that such ideas were slowly and grudgingly changed (Komara 1978:1). Cyrus N. Ray, an osteopathic surgeon, began searching for Early Man in the Abilene area of central west Texas in 1929 after reading about a nearby archeological site that yielded bones of a Pleistocene form of bison in association with Folsom artifacts (Komara 1978). Ray was convinced of man's antiquity in Texas.","As a pioneer investigator, he searched stream banks for deeply buried sediments that presumably would yield very old artifacts and human burials. From the cultural and skeletal materials uncovered by this strategy, he identified the Clear Fork culture and Abilene Man. Because Paleoamerican artifacts and the bones of Pleistocene megafauna were occasionally intermixed with artifacts assigned to the Clear Fork complex, Ray proposed that Clear Fork and Folsom period artifacts were contemporaneous (Ray 1939; Roberts 1940). This assessment was controversial and was later rejected, the Clear Fork complex being identified as a local Archaic manifestation (Komara 1978; Wulfkuhle 1986). Ray's work has been criticized for inadequate geological interpretations, inaccurate placement of artifacts within the archeological context, and vague site descriptions (Komara 1978)."

Furthermore, his works reflected a flair for detail and accuracy drawn from King's long years of military service during the Indian Wars. He was, in short, one of those rare authors who emerged at the right time and right place for immediate public acceptance. To dramatize King's importance as a social commentator on the American military system, Oliver Knight, prizewinning historian at the University of Texas at El Paso, has organized Life and Manners in the Frontier Army around these novels.

Certainly it is not easy, nor probably productive, to make a hard and fast distinction between the Archaic patterns and the preceding, and partly contemporary, Paleoindian way of life. Common to both adaptations are features such as the capture or control of both solitary and herding animals, seasonally scheduled movements between resource zones, and the selective consumption of plants and maritime products. It seems now that the Archaic stage is highly variegated and that it can be differentiated from the Paleoindian one mostly in a quantitative way, less successfully in some regions than others. Similarly, the distinctions between the various pathways followed by Archaic peoples, at least one of which led to agriculture, are sometimes indistinct but of great interest to those of us working in South American archaeology.",Wes Hurt was a pioneer in the study of South American Archaic differentiation.

Byrne Although there have always been many Albertans with a keen interest and, often, a profound knowledge of the prehistoric heritage of the province, for many the rich and complex pageant of ancient Alberta human occupations has remained a mystery. At the same time, the modern inhabitants have ever-increasingly exhibited a basic curiosity about the earlier events which ultimately led to present-day Alberta, and they have frequently expressed their interest in learning more about its prehistory. This concern on the part of Albertans has led to a sequence of events that saw the establishment of the Archaeological Survey of Alberta (ASA), which holds bright prospects for the future.","In the first part of this century, Albertans relied on passing reminiscences of pioneer settlers and hearsay accounts for depictions of life in ancient times. Beginning in the mid1930s, however, a succession of American professional archaeologists made periodic quests through the province. Dr. Junius Bird of the American Museum of Natural History, spent the greater part of the summer and fall of 1938 in Alberta, and visited many of the archaeological sites still considered to be of outstanding importance. In that same era Dr. Wes Bliss also spent some time in northern Alberta, and published his findings in a contemporary edition of Science. In 1949, Boyd Wettlaufer, under the auspices of the University of New Mexico, initiated what might properly be viewed as the first systematic attempt to excavate an archaeological site in the province, and although his pioneering investigations at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump did not reach fruition, they certainly established a pattern for later, more successful projects."

Around 1873, Bandelier met Lewis H. Morgan and a lengthy correspondence followed.","Morgan was a pioneer in the study of ethnology and anthropology. He had specialized in the Iroquois and presented the theory that the ""civilized"" Indians of Mexico, such as the Aztecs and Mayas, had in reality been little more advanced in their organization than the more ""primitive"" Indians. Morgan believed that civilizations progressed from a type of society based only on personal relations, which he called a ""societas,"" to more advanced types of social organization based on land and property, thus constituting a state.

And on rainy days, when we were not forced to go outside to look after stock, some time was devoted to repair of saddles, molding of bullets, cleaning of guns, and plaiting of hair ropes, or perhaps dressing buckskin for clothing. Pecans could be gathered when fields were muddy and other duties were not pressing. There were many other tasks such as making cloth sacks for wheat, digging wells for drinking water, building sugar cane mills for our limited supply of cane, cutting wood to fit the fireplaces, milking and churning, feeding the stock that were always around the house, and mending clothing and shoes.","But life for the pioneer settler was not all work and no play.

In synthesizing the information on an area as large as California, with prehistoric cultures as diverse as those found there, the Chartkoffs have necessarily organized the disparate data from professional reports around certain concepts and themes. Central to these is a chronological framework which divides the cultural and social evolution of California's prehistoric inhabitants into a series of successive blocks of time, each of which is characterized by similar statewide trends. Within each time period three themes exemplify the development of the archaeological cultures then present. The chronological record begins with what the Chartkoffs term the ""Paleo-Indian Period,"" starting with the initial settlement of the state and lasting until eleven thousand years ago.","Characteristics of this period include pioneer settlements, a focal economy emphasizing big-game hunting, and a universal technology. Particularly notable during this endof-the-ice-age time is the adaptation of the population to a desert lakeshore environment. This is followed by the ""Archaic Period,"" lasting from eleven thousand to four thousand years ago. Although the transition from Paleo-Indian to Archaic was relatively slow, the latter period can be viewed as one in which a diffuse economy developed, with penetration and exploitation of new environments and life zones and the beginnings of a refined and specialized technology. Unlike the Paleo-Indian Period's universality of culture across the state, the Archaic time was marked by culture change, as populations differentiated at varied rates, adapting to local environments and developing localized cultural traditions."

As a professional archaeologist and one who has been involved in cultural resource management and in many of the cases described in this book, I have seen firsthand the difficulties, profound emotions, and cultural clashes these topics expose.","It is a very hard road to pioneer and to follow.

After breakfast with the family, and before leaving, Boone sat in a chair by the stove while Mary combed out his long black hair, braided it in two pigtails and fastened them around the back and sides of his head.

mdp.39015057458518,Revista de música latinoamericana. Latin American music review,2005,113,10,Pioneer,1,,,Another pioneer in film music at DIVEDCO was José Raúl Ramírez.,"As other production aspects gained in sophistication, music also became better organized, more purposefully conceived, and more professional both in concept and in execution-but without completely losing its ties to the island's own modes of musical expression. The early recognition of the importance of music to film in the work of DIVEDCO can be attributed to Délano. Délano was himself a trained musician, and his musical skills answered an urgent need in the first films produced, as he turned his hand to a previously unexplored field: musical composition. Out of necessity he found himself performing “as a producer, director, teacher, composer, and cameraman. ""4 When Délano left the directorship of the DIVEDCO Film Division in 1952, he left the basic concepts of film music firmly established in the agency's program, and along with them some of the techniques involved in their realization.","Another pioneer in film music at DIVEDCO was José Raúl Ramírez. A professional pianist and organist, Ramírez was a student and colleague of José Enrique Pedreira, the most significant Puerto Rican composer of his generation and a fine pianist himself. Ramírez was initially engaged as an assistant to Délano, and through the years became an extremely versatile and valuable force in DIVEDCO films. Working alongside Délano from the earliest preDIVEDCO days, Ramírez performed a wide variety of duties. These tasks included selecting pre-existing recorded music, improvising transition music at the electronic organ, contracting musicians and groups for recording sessions, composing brief musical segments, occasionally directing recording sessions himself, and editing the resulting recordings."

I was glad to meet Ralph Hull, principal of the school there, with whom I had attended Normal School in Vancouver.","I remember the Henderson brothers, prominent pioneer farmers at Rolla. Instead of hauling their grain the long miles to Grande Prairie or Spirit River, they fed it to hogs which they marketed with less cost for transport. In Pouce Coupe, during winter, there was a ""round-the-clock"" poker game. Local and other participants could ""sit in"" for as long as they wished or until their luck and cash ran out. Late winter, before the trapping harvest came in, money was scarce so the bets would be covered in kind rather than in cash saddles, guns, or whatever."

We all know that arrows and bullets kill deer, but none of us is likely to lapse into the statement that bullets are fired by bows. Nevertheless, following Tylor, and many ethnographers who took their terms from him, we are prone to say that starchy roots are baked in earth ovens even when a moment's thought clearly shows that they were steamed in pressure cooking pits.

The school system is separate, even in towns that have a mixed Jewish/Arab population (e.g., Haifa, Acre, Lod, Ramle, Jaffa), and differs in language of instruction, curriculum (particularly in the humanities and social sciences), and budget allocations.22 While the subdivisions in the educational system give it an appearance of accommodation of cultural differences and educational pluralism, they exist more for the purpose of serving the interests of the dominant (Jewish) ethnic group, while maintaining control of the indigenous Palestinian Arab community.23 The educational system of the indigenous Palestinian Arabs has been, and continues to be, determined by a set of political criteria which they have no say in formulating.","The 1953 Law of State Education specified the following aims for state-sponsored education in Israel: “to base education on the values of Jewish culture and the achievements of science, on love of the homeland and loyalty to the state and the Jewish people, on practice in agricultural work and handicraft, on pioneer training and on striving for a society built on freedom, equality, tolerance, mutual assistance, and love of mankind. ”24 Though nearly fifty years have passed since the enactment of this law, the aims it specified remain central to current Israeli state educational policy. Though the law was amended in 2000, it maintains educational objectives for state schools that emphasize only Jewish values, history, and culture, while ignoring Palestinian values, history, and culture.25 As an example of how deeply these aims permeate all official discourse about education in Israel, current Minister of Education Limor Livnat stated in June 2001 that she would like to see that “there is not a single child in Israel” who did not learn “Jewish knowledge and values. ”26 Like other nations that consider themselves liberal democracies while at the same time discriminating against their indigenous people, government officials need not openly say that their goal is to provide an alienating and substandard education for indigenous people."

The complexities of tribal cultures varied among them. While witchcraft and pagan rites were practiced by certain groups, others believed in a Divine Being to whom they communicated through fasting and prayer.

Until recently, literature and movies have perpetuated the image of the ""scalping savage"" as applying to all Indians. Had all red men been hostile those first Europeans could not have lived to colonize America. Although our history is vague concerning this, we know that the Indians helped these people to survive in a strange new land. My admiration stems from the realization of the many hardships the Indian endured, his patience in developing a way of life by using the gifts of nature in creating tools, in testing plants to determine whether or not they were edible or suitable for medicine and his persistence in seeking a purpose in his life."

The patterns of the site nuclei have been classified and found to be of two types – linear and polarized patterns. These are a part of a continuum that also includes amorphous patterns. A discussion of the two types and variants of each pattern is included in Chapter 13 on the socioeconomic history of the area. Linear patterns occur on places that did not have clear separations of the house complex (domicile and related human structures) from the barn complex (animal structures and structures related to food production).","The sites with linear patterns are predicted to have been pioneer sites that did not change greatly in their orientations. The sites with polarized patterns, at the other end of the continuum, have clear separations of the house and barn complexes.

Southern and Northern efforts to resolve this concern to their section's satisfaction created a chain of events that in little more than a decade led to secession, then civil war. Probably a lesser concern to most Americans than the extension of slavery was the effects of overland migration and territorial expansion on relations with Indians. The events of the 1840s severely jeopardized the policy of Separation and the nation's solution to the Indian question by placing considerable stress on the tribes in the Indian Territory and those on the plains, disrupting their lives and environment, heightening intertribal hostilities, and reawakening interracial tensions. Amid the array of forces transforming the Far West, one thing remained constant, at least for the moment: Americans did not desire Indian lands on the prairies and plains.","Later mythology of American western settlement idyllically pictured fruitful prairies as far as the eye could see with “endless waves of grain” sustaining hearty pioneer families. But in fact, Americans looking for homes in the West during the 1840s pushed quickly beyond the plains to more familiar terrains, such as Oregon. They hastened westward along the overland trails partly from excited anticipation of a better life awaiting them at their destination, but also out of a primal terror of Indians. It affected all people on the overland trails. “We had been told,” Heinrich Lienhard confessed in his diary, “that somewhere along the Little Blue there was a large camp of [Indians] whose hostility toward the whites was generally feared. ..."

Although we cannot retrieve information that is not in the records, the new mission historians, like many other ethnohistorians, have tried to compensate for these methodological problems. Seeing missions within the framework of both native and a particular version of European culture—that of the Catholic missionaries—is an important step forward. Another advance is the incorporation of studies and concepts of the ""ethnographic present,"" and cultural anthropology in general, to explicate past behaviors. An awareness of problems, such as the dubious assumption that indigenous cultures experienced little change over centuries (an unlikely possibility in the case of the missions), makes possible a sophisticated analysis even with partial information dimly perceived through European eyes.","Thus, Susan Deeds' work on northern Mexico usefully combines ideas from James Scott and Edward Spicer, a pioneer in analyzing northern Mexican Indians from an anthropologically sensitive perspective. The European-Indian interactions illuminated by this multidisciplinary perspective help revise the traditional mission history. Clearly, the missionaries supervised the Indians closely and attempted quite consciously to change them in ways that were not possible in the European-dominated urban centers. This intense interaction, however, did not always have the consequences the official mission histories might have us believe. The Indians were often the victims of the missionary system rather than the happy recipients of European civilization, as David Sweet points out."

Arrell Morgan Gibson noted that most historians have largely overlooked or ignored evidence that the Indians were more than mere “bit players in the American historical drama.” Francis Paul Prucha asserted that ""until recent decades Indians did not occupy a very prominent place in writings about American history, and this disinterest and disdain were reflected in high school and college textbooks.” David Muzzey, for example, whose textbooks influenced generations of American school children in the early twentieth century, conceded, in his own words, that although the Indians “had some noble qualities ... at bottom they were a treacherous, cruel people.”","Too frequently writers, until recently, have portrayed the Indians simply as a savage barrier to American pioneer progress, characterizing them as cruel, barbarous, half-civilized, and childlike. This earlier historiographic pattern has changed dramatically from the 1960s onward, coinciding with, and initially stimulated by, the turbulent events of that decade. Activism bloomed among the American Indians as similar quickenings stirred among other disadvantaged groups in the United States. Increasingly, Indian activists urged the federal government to become more concerned about the difficulties of Indian life. They pointed out bitterly that of all minority groups in the United States, the American Indians were the poorest; three out of five lived below the federally established poverty line."

Although grades of removed viewpoint may be formally expressed, it is not clear what instigates them.

Bandelier was not only an archaeologist, ethnologist, and historian but he was also interested in botany, geology, geography, and zoology, and incorporated all these fields into his anthropological and historical studies. Bandelier also saw clearly the interrelation of the parts of culture, their relationship to the history of the region, and to the natural environment. Especially in anthropology, Bandelier utilized a kind of structural-functional analysis, a sophisticated form of which has become fashionable in more recent times.","Bandelier not only made important contributions to anthropological and historical methodology; he was also the leading nineteenth century pioneer of ethnohistorical and archival studies of the early post-Columbian Southwest. Bandelier's combination of methodological sophistication and control of the archival data makes the Marcos de Niza paper important, not only as a landmark in Southwestern ethnohistory but as a work of scholarship in its own right. This French version of Marcos (far more detailed and much longer than the commonly cited English version) gives insights on Cabeza de Vaca, Marcos, and on early Southwestern exploration that are valid today. Since Bandelier lacked certain documents either physically not available to him or actually discovered later, the Marcos paper does contain minor errors. For example the word Zum (and close variants of it) which Bandelier thought was introduced by Onate in 1598, was actually introduced in the early 1580s."

Yet the Indians generally viewed themselves as the earth's occupiers and custodians, not as its surveyors and engineers. Defining land as a commercial product like sugar or gunpowder, the whites measured it, bought it or stole it, fenced it, tilled or built upon it, with an abandon that horrified Indians. At the same time the colonists, whose society was founded on private ownership and consolidation of personal riches, looked disapprovingly at Indian customs of sharing land in common.

Since time immemorial, farmers have sought to modify climatic conditions in order to achieve a greater or more certain production of crops.

Town builders, real estate developers, and railroad officials hired writers, artists, and photographers to portray the wonders of irrigation, resulting in the wide distribution of lavish brochures and booklets across the country, particularly in the Midwest.6 Many irrigation schemes were overly ambitious and under capitalized, and some became defunct as state officials refused to regulate effectively or assist in these endeavors."

The cellar fill contained architectural materials (mortar, plaster, nails, hardware, and window glass), glass and ceramic tableware, kitchenware, personal items (such as sewing equipment, pipe fragments, shoes, buttons, and a religious medallion), and domestic and wild animal bone. Analysis of the recovered artifacts and documentary evidence indicates that the house was occupied by a tenant farmer and his family who worked for the Pingree family between 1870 and 1885, and perhaps earlier.

The pit was the picture of desolation, raw yellow soil mixed with gravel, upturned tree trunks, exposed sections of bedrock, rutted truck tracks, and standing puddles of muddy water. And yet, within a few months, that is toward the end of the first summer after the devastation, I noticed that reindeer moss was growing there.","The socalled reindeer moss is actually a lichen and is basically a pioneer plant. Not unlike sphagnum moss, it can grow in nutrient-poor environments, and like all lichens, it is a combination of two different plants, a fungus and an alga. The fungus is able to break down and release nutrients from rocks and poor soils, and the algal part of the plant is able to carry out photosynthesis—good insurance for survival in a hard climate. The Red Cowboy told me that sphagnum and reindeer moss were probably the most common plants on Scratch Flat in the recessional years of the glacier. Although there are variations on this view of the postglacial environment, there does seem to be a general consensus among botanists and geologists that after the glacier withdrew from the northeast, there was a lot of water around, and that in time plants grew in the water, and that the wetlands and the ponds and the lakes are slowly drying up and will disappear, and that, furthermore, on the dry land areas, small heathlike plants would have grown shortly after the ice disappeared."

In the “comparative vocabulary” section, Sapir mentioned “over three hundred distinct Athabaskan stems and grammatical elements” (p. 551). In the “phonology” section he listed thirty of “the more important (sound] correspondences” (pp. 554–5). In 1917 Sapir presented a large amount of lexical evidence in support of the Hokan hypothesis (1917a); it so impressed Dixon and Kroeber (1919:103—4) that “they considered themselves exonerated from the obligation to present further justification of their Hokan stock” (Langdon 1974:37). Three years later, Sapir grouped together Hokan and the so-called Coahuiltecan languages (see Chapter 8), including also Tonkawa and Karankawa, based on 120 lexical similarities unevenly spread throughout the languages (Sapir 1920).","He readily admitted the shaky (or preliminary) nature of his findings: “A certain amount of groping in the dark cannot well be avoided in the pioneer stage of such an attempt as this” (1920:289). Sapir's article on Subtiaba (1925a) is considered by many scholars to be the major statement on Hokan, and more important, a clear statement dealing with Sapir's method of distant genetic hypotheses (see Chapter 7). The most common criticism levied at Sapir's proposals has not concerned the kind of evidence or the methods he employed but rather whether the available evidence warranted the conclusions he reached. For example, Truman Michelson 103 favored morphological criteria for genetic relationships similar to those used by Sapir but strongly disagreed with the conclusions of Sapir's Ritwan-Algonquian article (1913). Michelson based this objection on the many Wiyot and Yurok morphological traits that “are thoroughly un-Algonquian” (1914:362), claiming also that some of the resemblances among morphological elements are erroneous or accidental and that some morphological elements of Wiyot and Yurok strongly resemble those of various non-Algonquian languages."

For example, within the deciduous forests of eastern North America, an area can change from poor deer range to good deer range and back again in the course of 10 years (Hosley 1956:242). Another significant consideration here is the dynamic nature of the relationship between people and ecosystem and the systemic effects that decreased mobility would have on altering the environment. As duration of settlement increases, we could expect a corresponding increase in the alteration of local habitats as a result of such factors as clearing or disturbing ground, either intentionally or unintentionally.","Such disturbance, as noted previously, can foster the growth of pioneer annual weeds or certain critical herbaceous plants or brambles, and in addition may increase deer productivity by increasing forage.

It must be understood that aboriginal water rights are derived from different origins than those of non-aboriginal persons. They cut across the rights of non-aboriginal persons. The conflict has been extensively considered in the United States. Trelease explains how it developed: Since little settlement had taken place before most reservations were established, the Indian reserved rights are on the whole prior to and superior to the off-reservation appropriations.","Yet the descendants and successors of the pioneer farmers and ranchers who settled the public domain have made water scarce in most of the west, they have put it to use in extensive development and large projects while most Indian rights have lain dormant. In other words, the Indians have had the water rights but the white men now have the water."" The succinct statement, that the ""Indians have had the water rights but the white men now have the water"", is equally applicable in Canada. Trelease comments on the likely pattern in the future: Inevitably this will change. Simply because the off-reservation users have appropriated all of the water (or all of the easily available water), the Indian rights are not to be denied nor Indian development stymied."

Recognizing the opportunities provided by the sutler and the Indian trade, Fellows David Pease had goods transferred to Fort Totten from Fort Berthold in early September 1867. The merchandise was hauled by company wagons and oxen with all goods, equipment, and animals being charged to the company's Fort Totten account. A. Bassett, the Fort Totten manager, later complained that Pease and Gustave Cagnot, the company's Fort Berthold factor, had charged him with unsellable goods and dilapidated wagons in order to remove them from the accounts of the Missouri River posts.""","When he decided to extend the company's business from the Missouri River to Fort Totten, Pease certainly realized he was entering into direct competition with Charles A. Ruffee, the overland mail contractor who was also the fort's pioneer storekeeper. As events transpired, however, Ruffee proved to be more of a customer than a competitor, mainly because his overland mail service was chronically in debt. A native of Nova Scotia, Ruffee moved to Minnesota in 1857 when he was nineteen years old. Working as a stage driver, mail carrier, and Indian trader, he generally lived in the frontier villages of Otter Tail City and Crow Wing before becoming the successful bidder on the government's northern mail route from Fort Abercrombie to Helena, Montana. In the summer of 1867, while the construction of Fort Totten was underway, Ruffee led a party from Fort Abercrombie to Helena to locate the mail route and establish its stations."

In 1884 he tried to gain Bates's financial support in reviving some of the old government claims, but the wary Bates responded that he was not inclined ""to send good money after bad.""” Collecting from the government became Hubbell's obsession. He solicited testimonials from former workers, and in 1902 and 1903, while paralyzed and living in a St. Paul hotel, he made final futile efforts to collect from the government by appealing to Knute Nelson, Minnesota's senior United States senator, and contacting a Washington, D.C., lawyer.” While striving to revive the old claims, Hubbell publicized his role in the Northwest Fur Company.","Somewhat romantically, he reminisced about his Upper Missouri adventures in his bid to be remembered as an enterprising pioneer. He corresponded with Hiram Martin Chittenden to assure that the company was mentioned in Chittenden's History of Early Steamboat Navigation on the Missouri River and wrote several articles for St. Paul newspapers.” Conclusion During its brief existence, the Northwest Fur Company, as the largest trading firm on the Upper Missouri, enjoyed a regional distinction. Its owners, despite their unethical dealings with the government and the Indians, were commonly regarded by the press as some of the area's distinguished men. To many of their contemporaries, they apparently seemed to exemplify frontier peoples' overriding passion for development."

Open-range ranchers were displaced by smaller-scale cattlemen whose operations were based on private property and on more intensive and costly methods of livestock production. Sometimes referred to as ""ranch farmers"" because they cultivated feed and cash crops, many of the earliest small-scale owner-operators in North Dakota were cowboys who had come into the area while working for the open-range outfits, and who then stayed on and acquired land after the enclosure of the range. Others were themselves homesteaders or the children of homesteaders.

While some of the permittees continued to secure grazing lands from either the Bureau of Indian Affairs or from individual Indian land owners, the social relations of production were transformed from collective to individual land utilization and labor practices. By the 1950s, most Killdeer and Dunn county ranchers had switched from steer production to more capital and labor intensive cow-calf operations, while mechanization and automation increased and trucking replaced the cattle drives.","Today many ranching families remember those who rode in the ""Big Lease"" as having been the true pioneer cattlemen in North Dakota.

Many of our current methods in historic site development and interpretation date to the 1960s and '70s, but in the last twenty-five years, there is evidence of change in western historic sites as well, in many cases for the better. One example is the Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which, as amended in 1980 and 1992, has encouraged historians, historical architects, and archeologists to look more closely at the significance of local and state history. Creating a mechanism for the identification and appreciation of local history, the program of the National Register of Historic Places has led to the designation and, in some cases, protection of important regional properties, such as the Grassy Butte Post Office in McKenzie County, North Dakota, that would have never fit into the nationally significant category of westward expansion. Another impetus for change came from events in the mid-1970s, like the American Bicentennial of 1976 and the amazing popularity of the Roots television movie, which further encouraged new interest in history and, consequently, the development of local museums, historic sites, living history farms, and pioneer villages.”","This emphasis on local history has resulted in a plethora of historic house museums, like the Former Governors' Mansion State Historic Site in Bismarck, and the creation of pioneer villages, a sort of adaptation of the reconstruction ideas of the 1930s.

By the early 1930s the archival discipline had developed to the point where local, state, and federal officials were aware that public records should be preserved and made accessible.

Until 1892 the San Juan Canyon below Bluff seems not to have been prospected; at least no important discoveries were made public. The lure of the Merrick-Mitchell mine probably kept most gold hunters out of the canyon and no record has been found of any of the Glen Canyon miners working their way up the San Juan River from its mouth, although they probably tried to do so.

Although project administrators requested support to continue and complete Work Project 1083, funding and staffing continued to decrease. In January Photographer Leo D. Harris of Killdeer, North Dakota, labeled this WPA picture he took as ""a typical North Dakota ranch home"" and may be typical of those field workers visited for their Historical Data Project interviews.

The Historical Data Project had been winding down for several months, and it was closed during the summer of 1941.31 Although Historical Data Project promoters had high expectations, the project's success was limited by the problems common to all WPA work-relief projects. A fundamental problem was the conflict between the project's two objectives. The State Historical Society's primary objective was to gather materials for its archives, library, and museum. Using workers from the relief rolls was the means to an end."

umn.319510028898703,The Final report of the national reservoir inundation study /,1981,93,11,Pioneer,1,,,"During these initial stages of plant succession, rapidly germinating pioneer species are dominant.","Reservoir impacts to modern vegetation are not limited to zones of permanent inundation but extend to the reservoir shoreline, back shore, and downstream zones as well. Most man-made reservoirs experience varying degrees of water-level fluctuation due to seasonal fluctuations in input and output, resulting in seasonal shoreline fluctuations. As the reservoir water level rises during a flood stage, there is an increase in available moisture along the new shoreline. Aided by wave and capillary action, moisture penetrates laterally into the adjacent soils and stimulates plant growth. As the water level recedes during drawdown, the emerging drawdown zone functions as a seedbed for the germination of windand water-dispersed seeds.","During these initial stages of plant succession, rapidly germinating pioneer species are dominant. Since plant succession is usually a very gradual process, the establishment of a climax vegetation community will depend on the duration of the drawdown and the extent of alteration of the physical and chemical properties of the shoreline soils. In reservoirs subject to frequent water-level fluctuations, the native vegetation will probably never recover from the impact of initial"

In those cases where a lowered water level is the motivating event in planning postinundation research, it is highly recommended that archeologists and resource managers plan investigations as quickly as possible. Water retreating from a land face after long-term inundation creates a condition in which surviving resources are particularly vulnerable to additional impact. The saturated soils are weakly bonded and particularly susceptible to sheet erosion from runoff and wind erosion, especially since the protective vegetative mantle is gone. Cultural remains are also much more visible, and sites are more easily located at this time by archeologists and pot hunters alike.","It is incumbent upon the archeologist to get to these resources before the vandals and before pioneer vegetal growth moves in to obscure sites and make resurvey more difficult. An additional consideration in this regard is the propensity for faunal impacts to increase. For instance, at Folsom Reservoir in California, surviving occupation floors were invaded by raccoons. They were exploiting the clams which had selected the organically rich cultural deposits as a home (Foster and Bingham 1977). A final point must be made regarding archeological investigation during the operation and maintenance phase: When dealing with already inundated sites, the archeologist should make strong use of the information in this report and others that addresses the question of biochemical impacts to analytical and dating techniques."

This brief overview of the past helps us understand some of the traditions that we still use today, which brings us to the present. Many of our current methods in historic site development and interpretation date to the 1960s and '70s, but in the last twenty-five years, there is evidence of change in western historic sites as well, in many cases for the better. One example is the Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which, as amended in 1980 and 1992, has encouraged historians, historical architects, and archeologists to look more closely at the significance of local and state history. Creating a mechanism for the identification and appreciation of local history, the program of the National Register of Historic Places has led to the designation and, in some cases, protection of important regional properties, such as the Grassy Butte Post Office in McKenzie County, North Dakota, that would have never fit into the nationally significant category of westward expansion.","Another impetus for change came from events in the mid-1970s, like the American Bicentennial of 1976 and the amazing popularity of the Roots television movie, which further encouraged new interest in history and, consequently, the development of local museums, historic sites, living history farms, and pioneer villages.” This emphasis on local history has resulted in a plethora of historic house museums, like the Former Governors' Mansion State Historic Site in Bismarck, and the creation of pioneer villages, a sort of adaptation of the reconstruction ideas of the 1930s. The popularity of moving together a collection of historic buildings to create a town setting, clearly influenced by the precedent of Greenfield Village, has lasted for more than forty years on the northern plains. North Dakota, for example, has Bonanzaville, U.S.A., in West Fargo, the Joachim Regional Museum and Prairie Outpost Park in Dickinson, the Frontier Village in Jamestown, and the Grant County Historical Museum in Elgin. These recreated villages often preserve valuable individual historic properties, but they usually do so out of historical and geographical context."

Although its initial function was to coordinate relief efforts at the state level, FERA quickly assumed a leadership role in designing proposals for work programs. The Civil Works Administration (CWA), for example, was established in November 1933 as a complement to FERA. Its charge: to put men to work as quickly as possible at almost any worthwhile jobs available. By January 1934 the CWA had employed more than four million men, and between November 1933 and July 1934 it had pumped almost a billion dollars into the economy.","FERA also pioneered in providing work relief for ""white-collar"" workers."" White-collar unemployment, for many reasons, presented peculiar difficulties, not only for the whitecollared who were unemployed, but also for those who attempted to design programs to help them. One reason was that the unemployed and destitute white-collar workers felt the impact of the Great Depression less severely and later than manual workers. There was also the matter of pride.

The original spans were trapezoidal and remained in existence until 1905. The difficulty in finding good workers was another problem for Morison. He noted that ordinary laborers were paid, on average, $2.00 a day, and that the labor in this country was of an inferior character, and very difficult to control, the men generally being indifferent as to whether they worked or not, and entirely ready to be discharged. It frequently happened that gangs of men sent out from St. Paul to work on the bridge disappeared almost as soon as they arrived.”","This may best be illustrated by the recollections of James Melarvie, a local pioneer who worked for four days on the bridge caissons as a cement mixer: I was wheeling cement on a wheel-barrow out to the mixer about seventy-five or one hundred feet.

The inevitable consequence, Veblen maintained, was the looting of the nation's nonrenewable resources to enrich the privileged few. The fur trade, Veblen said, represented this kind of exploitation and was “an unwritten chapter on the debauchery and manslaughter entailed upon the Indian population of the country.” The sheer nastiness of this rotten business was such that it produced, according to Veblen, “the sclerosis of the American soul.”","Another perceptive witness of the ecological impact of the frontier in the late nineteenth century was John Muir, son of a Scottish pioneer and a person who, like Veblen, labored on a farm as a boy in the Portage, Wisconsin, area.

""This finishes up the pioneers in Velva that I can find.","Of course,"" she wrote, ""there are some who really pioneered but [who] do not qualify as actual pioneers.""” No matter what the official description of a pioneer was, however, many field workers—because they were the ones who came in contact with the people living in each community—developed their own description. A pioneer was more than likely a man, someone old, someone prominent in the community who had endured hardship and who had contributed significantly to the development of his community. Using these and other criteria, some individuals were so prominent in the community that they had to be included; field workers prepared files on individuals who clearly were not pioneers according to the project's criteria, and they must also have omitted from consideration individuals who just as clearly were. Perhaps 80 percent of the Historical Data Project files are identified by a man's name, and many of those identified by a woman's name contain more material about the woman's husband, father, or other male relative than they do about her."

Ironically, the idea of sportsmanship in hunting was not a part of the American frontier heritage; it had been introduced by a group of English immigrants in the 1830s. The sportsman's code slowly took root in the United States among the upper class in the cities of the Northeast in the 1840s, but it failed to get very much further in the United States for another generation. It was the irreversible destruction and great wastage of the buffalo during the 1870s that first awakened a large segment of the American public to the need for a new wildlife conservation ethic. In that decade, scores of game clubs and sport hunting magazines were launched; and in the following two decades, several states passed game laws with the object of preserving a continuous supply of game for sport hunting.","Yet most state game laws remained ineffectual at the turn of the century, and in many parts of the country the sportsman's code had barely made inroads on the old pioneer ethic of hunting, in which animals were slain for practical uses as efficiently as possible and with no thought for the future.23 Sportsmen-conservationists generally believed that the so-called “pot hunter” who did not obey the game laws was not incorrigible; he was simply backward.

In line with other national park master plans of this era, Vint's plan aimed to provide tourists with a choice of long-term or short-term visits, rustic or sophisticated accommodations, and automobile-oriented or backcountry experiences. These proposed developments might succeed in getting tourists close to nature, but they would tend to insulate the tourist from the Alaskan frontier.

By 1872, the railroad had sent its iron horse chugging through Oklahoma’s fertile plains. Now there was no stopping land-hungry pioneers. By the 1880s the U.S. government and its mounted infantry and cavalry regiments formed a thin blue line of protection against white intruders. But there was no stemming this white lust for settlement.","A dream of land and an appetite for economic gain had always powered the white pioneer spirit. It soon collided with a Federal pledge to keep Native Americans safe on these lands. A white “boomer” invasion began in 1880, truculently crashing through to build camps, only to be ejected by the U.S. Army. White and black soldiers, often reluctantly, escorted boomers out each time. The boomers grew to an estimated forty thousand, and most swore an oath to keep ﬁghting until Oklahoma was theirs."

Though Barton discovered it, the Cherokee affinity with other Iroquoian languages was conclusively demonstrated only much later by Horatio Hale (1883) (see below). Alexander von Humboldt employed Barton's data in a sort of “mass comparison,” but he arrived at generally erroneous conclusions (1811, 1:101–2). He had compared Barton's vocabularies and found ""a few word similarities between the languages of Tartary and those of the New World” (Greene 1960:514; Barton himself had given a list of fifty-four such similarities), and three years later, citing data from both Barton and Vater, he concluded: Development of American Indian Historical Linguistics Roger Williams In North America, Williams's (1603–1683) work on the Algonquian languages of New England is considered an important early contribution to American Indian linguistics; A Key into the Language of America (1643) was very influential.21 Of special interest is his discovery of what is in effect an Algonquian sound correspondence involving n, l, r, and y in several of the New England Algonquian languages (1643; Haas 1967b:817).","John Eliot (1604–1690), another famous New England pioneer, observed the same correspondence (except for y): “We in Massachusetts pronounce N; the Nipmuck Indians pronounce L; and the Northern Indians pronounce R” (1966; quoted in Haas 1967b:817; see also Pickering 1833). The same correspondence set was observed again later by Pickering and Duponceau, and was confirmed much later in Algonquian linguistic studies (Haas 1967b: 817). This is significant, given the erroneous claim that sound change played no role in American Indian linguistics (see the section of sound correspondences later in this chapter). Investigations made with the most scrupulous exactness, in following a method which had not hitherto been used in the study of etymologies, have proved, that there are a few words that are common in the vocabularies of the two continents. In eighty three American languages, examined by Messrs. Barton and Vater, one hundred and seventy words have been found, the roots of which appear to be the same; and it is easy to perceive that this analogy is not accidental. . . ."

When ethnohistorian Omer C. Stewart began in 1952 to reconstruct for the Shoshone Land Claims Case the boundaries of aboriginal Shoshone territory, he painstakingly plotted onto a series of maps the known locations for the five major groups of Shoshone from over four dozen sources (Stewart 1966). In so far as these northeastern Shoshoneans were concerned, with the exception of James Doty's 1863 map all his major sources concurred that in aboriginal times these peoples claimed a portion of present-day Yellowstone National Park, as had been decreed in the Ft. Laramie Treaty of 1851 (citing Royce 1899; Powell 1891; Kroeber 1925; Steward 1937; Stewart 1966). While most of his sources also agreed that at least the lower southwestern third of the park had clearly been Shoshone territory, both Kroeber (1925) and Steward (1937) pushed that boundary even farther north, placing more than two-thirds of the present-day park within the aboriginal limits of Shoshone land.","Among the Flathead, we may recall from Chapter 2, it was generally understood, according to the well-informed pioneer ethnographer James Teit, that “Shoshonean tribes occupied the Upper Yellowstone country, including Yellowstone Park” (Teit 1930:304, emphasis ours). As Teit continued with the Flathead view of Shoshone territoriality: “Farther north Shoshonean bands occupied the country around Livingston, Lewiston and Denton. How far east and down the Yellowstone they extended is not known; but they are thought to have at one time held the country around Billings, and most, if not all, of the country where the Crow Indians now have a reservation.” Summarizing the Shoshonean perspective, Brigham D. Madsen has described the broader Shoshone and Bannock historical domain (during the 19th century) as follows: In the beginning they claimed and roamed over a territory extending from the Wind River Mountains, the Yellowstone Park country, and the buffalo plains of Montana on the west to the Weiser-Boise-Bruneau valleys of the west, and from Great Salt Lake and Bear Lake on the south to the Salmon River of the north. The twin hearts of this immense area were Camas Prairie and the Portneuf-Snake River bottoms, the first a summer home and the latter a sheltered haven against winter storms [Madsen 1980:223, emphasis ours)."
umn.31951p009596356,American Indians and Yellowstone National Park : a documentary overview /,2002,254,14,Pioneer,1,,,"We would hope today, with Americans seeking “a dramatic new park ethic” (Los Angeles Times, August 3, 1997, p. M4), that Yellowstone would become a pioneer in viewing its custodianship of a well-aged, multi-stranded American Indian past as an educational and promotional asset.","For in the wake of the divisive Civil War, one of the underlying reasons for creating such parks was that they produced sacred landscapes which all American pilgrims could visit in order to see their shared God manifest his powers and heal their wounded nation (for such use of parks like Niagara Falls, Yosemite and Yellowstone as centers of nationalistic tourism, see Sears 1989). But as soon as Yellowstone National Park scholars and the Albright Visitor Center exhibits began to create and promote their own stories of why and how Yellowstone became a park in the first place, the park itself opened the door to such a redefinition by adding themes of human culture history to the earlier emphases upon natural history, wildlife preservation, and scenic grandeur. And once it fleshed out the human personalities, administrative as well as artistic, who advocated for, painted pictures of, and fashioned the park's mandate and image, and put them into historical context, it thereupon left the safe realm of leaveit-alone wilderness and entered the realm of public relations and self-conscious discourse. While it seems a small step from this self-reflective, often self-congratulatory focus to bringing the complex stories of Indians more fully into the panorama of the park's culture history, the fact is that, as the debate over establishment of the Pajarito or Cliff Dwellers’ National Park demonstrated years ago, national parks designed around the allure of American Indian culture, prehistoric and historic, have had a hard time appealing to legislators and tourists in the past (Altherr 1985). But the failure of the Pajarito effort occurred in another era (1900– 1920), when Indians history was not of as general interest as they are now.","We would hope today, with Americans seeking “a dramatic new park ethic” (Los Angeles Times, August 3, 1997, p. M4), that Yellowstone would become a pioneer in viewing its custodianship of a well-aged, multi-stranded American Indian past as an educational and promotional asset. We would also hope that just as everyone is now aware that notions of parks as pristine “wilderness” are antiquated, and that human beings have been shaping their environmental surroundings for thousands of years, that the pre-contact, historic, and contemporary relations between Indians and the region not be hampered by externally imposed criteria for what are “pristine” and 238"

When Kino was conceiving his great expedition to the Colorado in 1700 to prove that California was not an island, Father González wrote him: “If you accomplish this, we must erect to you a costly and famous statue. And if the way is short, there will be two statues.” The way to California was not short, but the accomplishments of Kino's career have already merited him many more than two statues. The state of Arizona decided to honor Father Eusebio Francisco Kino in 1961 when several Arizona legislators introduced a Joint Memorial (Nº. 5) asking that the Congress of the United States accept Padre Kino as the subject for the state's second statue in the National Hall of Statuary.","Padre Kino had by that time already been recognized as the state's first pioneer, explorer, and cartographer. The statue proposal and resolution created new problems because the regulations for statues in the National Hall do not permit purely imaginary conceptions of historical persons. Since the only reputed portrait of Kino was burned in the San Francisco fire of 1907, and no other known portrait of Kino existed, the unusual procedure was devised of creating a likeness from photos of family descendants, using salient and recurrent features. A special committee, designated by Governor Paul Fannin, began an intensive search for a portrait artist. To everyone's satisfaction they commissioned the renowned Tucson artist Frances O'Brien to portray Kino as he may have looked."

The New York Times (July 10, 1932) stated; ""Very much of a man Colonel James Buckner Barry, whose modest story of his experiences in the pioneer days of Texas makes this book.”","And the New York Herald Tribune (July 17, 1932) declared Barry ""was absolutely fearless,"" yet ""His fame rests not upon flaming deeds but upon being a solid citizen, one of the substantial pioneers who kept their word, worked hard, fought Indians, loved their families and their state.” The Boston Evening Transcript (July 9, 1932) affirmed that Barry's adventures constitute ""a real epic of personal adventure. ..."" ""To his uncommon knowledge of human nature and Indian character Barry added the characteristic of selfpossession and promptness in action so essential to a frontier leader.” Allen Peden wrote (See the Houston Gargoyle, July 3, 1932): ""Readers such books as this (BUCK BARRY) one is again reminded that the alleged troubles of this soft age of ours would have seemed puny to the he-men who fought the battles of the wilderness.” However, Americans now are engaged in a struggle to preserve their principles and ideals."

Between 1909 and 1913, Moore, sponsored by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, conducted mound surveys and excavations during four expeditions along a number of river systems in Louisiana (Moore 1909, 1911, 1912, 1913). Many details of these expeditions and their operating procedures have been discussed in the Arkansas section of this history During the 1908-1909 expedition Moore explored the Ouachita, Little, and Boeuf rivers and Bayou Bartholomew, and excavated a minimum of 726 human skeletons (Moore 1909)."

The skeleton, although seemingly articulated and buried in an extended position, was missing the left clavicle, the left patella, bones of the right hand, and portions of both feet. These losses seemingly could not be attributed to preburial scavenger activity nor to postinterment rodent activity. The missing skeletal elements, coupled with a correspondence in age, sex, and race, identify this person as a ranchhand captured and mutilated by natives, an event referred to in an early interview with a local rancher (Finnegan 1980).

And royalty has always been an unconscious but all-consuming goal of the European immigrant. The early colonists, accustomed to life under benevolent despots, projected their understanding of the European political structure onto the Indian tribe in trying to explain its political and social structure. European royal houses were closed to ex-convicts and indentured servants, so the colonists made all Indian maidens princesses, then proceeded to climb a social ladder of their own creation.

The present climate in east central Minnesota is continental and characterized by the extremes of hot, humid summers and very cold winters. Recorded temperatures for the area range from a summer high of 109° F to a winter low of -44° F.

The need for conferences such as the one held here is apparent, and the necessity for additional conferences will undoubtedly grow during the next several years. Meanwhile, what will be accomplished during the present discussion is to review several current research themes consistent with the goals of this conference. As a means of providing background information, a range of opinion on several following topics is presented to set the stage for more specific discussion in the symposium papers. CHRONOLOGY, ORIGINS AND","THE PIONEER PERIOD Although the subject of this paper does not focus upon the traditional research problems of Hohokam origins and chronology, a few brief comments should be made to preface later discussions. When Haury reversed his long-held position that the Hohokam had evolved from an indigenous preceramic horizon (Haury et al. 1950; Haury 1957) and opted for an early Pioneer period migration of a small population from the south into the Phoenix Basin (Haury 1976), he fully expected this position to be challenged. This is, in fact, what has taken place during the past 10 years. A number of researchers (Wilcox and Shenk 1977; Plog 1980) have suggested that a strong case can still be made for the evolution of local Archaic populations into the sedentary, food producing ceramic culture we know as the Hohokam."

A system of shifting or swidden agriculture may have been in use, but the corn production would certainly have promoted construction of field systems because corn has to be grown plant by plant, hill by hill, and cannot be broadcast as was possible with earlier Woodland crop carry-overs in the Great Oasis agricultural system. The development of the scapula hoe seems closely tied to the kind of intensive field systems proposed. The Great Oasis settlement model is one of floodplain farming hamlets on Holocene terraces in association with agricultural fields, and occasional upland or side valley camps, all in association with upland cemeteries. The overall distribution of Great Oasis sites is large, and based on site density, the epicenter of Great Oasis activity is in the Sioux City, Iowa area (Figure 30).","The central lowa localities may represent pioneer communities, which moved into central lowa from this main cluster, or they may represent an indigenous Great Oasis development locally as well.

Although fear of the invading Apache and Comanche pressured many of the Indians to seek the protection of the missions, they were now exposed to the exploitation of the Spanish (Campbell 1975:2, 1991:346–347). The newly formed government of Texas gave land grants that were large, consisting of around 5,000 acres for each property, and Spanish cattle ranching became prevalent south and southeast of San Antonio (Jackson 1986), however the vast expanse west of San Antonio toward the Twin Buttes/Concho River region was not settled until the late 1800s. Around 1840, settlers from Germany and Alsace-Lorraine and from other regions of the United States began to move into the Hill Country to the north, settling into communities such as Boerne, to raise sheep or cattle (Freeman 1994:5–9). Although the Fisher-Miller land grant contract with the Republic of Texas was not entirely successful, it did provide the impetus for John Muesebach to initiate a peace treaty with the Comanches occupying the region (King 1967:111-118; Tiling 1913:100).","Finally, the arrival of pioneer ranchers such as Richard F.

It is interesting to note that although Bryan's party traversed the area in the summer (June and July), and Bartlett's in the fall (October), neither of them mentioned large herds of bison that later travelers did. Early Settlement in the Twin Buttes Area The Twin Buttes/Concho River area was still an unsettled frontier by the 1850s. Remnants of the Kotsoteka and Penateka bands of Comanches still occupied the areas west and east of modern-day San Angelo respectively (Kavanaugh 1986:282–285). The Butterfield Overland Mail stage line ran through the area crossing the South Concho just west of the Twin Buttes Reservoir, and the upper Middle Concho before heading westward to El Paso, from 1857 until 1861 and the beginning of the Civil War (Bitner 1931:17).","A few pioneer ranchers dared venture into the Concho Valley in the 1860s. R. F. Tankersley arrived at the head of the South Concho in 1864 aboard an ox-drawn wagon with his wife Annie, six children, 700 head of cattle, and 45 horses. The area was brimming with wildlife such as turkeys, antelope, deer, wild mustangs, coyotes, panthers, beavers, fish, and buffalo in herds “like great swarms of flies” (Barton 1998:38–39). Richard Tankersley's choice of grazing land along the South Concho was a wise one; in 1869 he herded 1,700 head to San Bernadino, California. Although he lost 700 head along the way, he received $25 per head for the 1,000 steers that made the hot, dry trip (Barton 1998:53–54)."

Myres thus sees Lafitau as a transitional figure among the great thinkers: “When, therefore, the first curiosity and wonder began to subside, and the real similarity in the performances of human reason under similar circumstances began to be perceived, the foundations began to be laid for a fresh statement of the characteristics of non-social man.","Whether the synthesis was to have a psychological or historical content was still a matter of uncertainty; but in spite of all his eccentricities, I think we may count Lafitau as a pioneer of a new line of work. ...""

Columbus, in one critic's words, ""could be seen as the original prototype of the American adventurer/hero who, like Boone or Crockett or Carson, blazed trails into an unknown wilderness so that others might follow and begin building the American Empire. ""78","It was this pioneer whom Turner celebrated in his speech. The question of American empire—past and future—figured prominently in his narrative as well. He composed an exalted tale of (male, European) trailblazers driven westward into unknown lands, compelled by a force the nineteenth century labeled ""manifest destiny,"" and in the process creating ""America."" His story, then, like the one told by the World's Columbian Exposition, concerned the nature of European America's identity and its history. Like the story of Columbus, Turner's tale has attained the status of myth, long dominating both academic and popular cultural versions of America's origins.79 77 James Skelton, cited in Badger, Great American Fair, 100."

In Turner's view, by ""going native""—in a limited way and for a limited time—the colonists were thus inculcated with an Americanness in the making. It is important to remember, however, that this regression into savagery was not an end in itself. Although the passage conceals their agency and denies their mastery (""the wilderness masters the colonist""), Turner's colonists in fact went native in order to overcome savagery, in order to establish their dominion over the Indians and the wilderness—in other words, to further the course of colonial progress.","Turner, then, saw the Indian as a predecessor of the pioneer and, hence, of civilization. This formulation clearly shows the influence of emergent social evolutionary conceptions of race, specifically those of Morgan, which similarly placed ""primitive"" peoples in civilization's past. It also reflected nineteenth-century notions of progress on which social evolution depended. Progress, in fact, underlay Turner's vision of the frontier experience, and this was why, for him, the experience created American identity. On the frontier, ""complex European life"" met ""the simplicity of primitive conditions"" (37)."

For some citizens to the west in Idaho Territory, for instance, an oft-quoted editorial from a Boise newspaper in the fall of 1867, expressed their widely shared sentiment towards Indians at this time: This would be our plan of establishing friendship on an eternal basis with our Indians: Let all the hostile bands of Idaho Territory be called in (they will not be caught in any other manner) to attend a grand treaty; plenty of blankets and nice little trinkets distributed among them; plenty of grub on hand; have a jolly time with them; then just before the big feast put strychnine in their meat and poison to death the last mother's son of them [Idaho Statesman, Boise, Idaho, October 6, 1867).","any native obstacle, Shoshone, Bannock or otherwise, to Wyoming's incoming pioneers, was reflected in this editorial from a major Wyoming newspaper only two years later: The Indians must stand aside or be overwhelmed by the ever advancing and ever increasing tide of emigration. The destiny of the aborigines is written in characters not to be mistaken. The same inscrutable Arbiter that decreed the downfall of Rome, has pronounced the doom of extinction upon the redmen of America. The attempt to defer this result by mawking sentimentalism in favor of savages is unworthy of a great people... If these Indian treaties have got into such a tangled knot that they cannot be untied, the sword of the pioneer will sever them [Cheyenne Daily Leader, March 3, 1870)."

All of these ideas would later be borrowed by Knoblock who, ironically, would fail to acknowledge Moorehead's publication Stone Ornaments in his bibliography, the source for so many of his concepts. While I have been critical of Knoblock, certainly no one has made a greater contribution toward an better understanding of the bannerstone.

Many of his hypotheses concerning the evolution of types by evaluating a face and end view are surprisingly accurate. This study draws from much of Knoblock's material. In analyzing Knoblocks work, the difficulty of his task is expressed by his evolutionary theories which were developed without any correlation to the stratigraphic record."

Holland Abstract Historic documents and archaeological evidence produced by investigations of the ColClough Farmstead in Oktibbeba County, Mississippi, shed new light on economic strategies, farmstead layout, and consumer practices on moderately size farms in the antebellum and postbellum Upland South. Introduction During the last two decades, the focus of many historical archaeologists working in the South has turned from the visually and socially compelling plantation site to the widespread yet less understood farmstead. For generations, and until World War II, the majority of Southerners lived and worked on small or medium-sized farms. The establishment of such farms, from the East Coast westward, was both the impetus and foundation for the settlement of many regions, including sections of northeastern Mississippi.","The lifestyle and daily routines of the early settlers and pioneer farmers of this region are generally understudied. Excavation and subsequent analysis of the Colclough Farmstead, 220k973, by TRC Garrow Associates, Inc. under contract with the Mississippi Department of Transportion, was a Phase III data recovery project required by the National Historic Preservation Act (Pietak, Holland, and Benyshek 1999). The research has contributed significant information regarding the area's culture history, and provides a database for comparative research with other regions of the South. The site, now on land belonging to the Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge, was a farmstead and, later, tenant housing, occupied between ca. 1840-1940 (Figure 1)."

Fortunately, he quickly acquired the English name of Simon, singular enough to stand out in these records, in addition to his own native name. This is remarkable because slaves usually lost any personal identity, becoming known by the name of their ancestral village or tribe, which served as a constant insult to that community (Tweddell 1974:120). No other Simon, who clearly grows appreciably older through the years, appears in these records.

As we shall discuss in greater detail below, one of the five adobes erected by the Narvaez family is believed to have been situated within the northeastern quadrant of the Rubino Property. Two other adobes were erected by members of the Narvaez family in relatively close proximity to the southeast, but apparently well beyond the borders of the present project area (Hendry and Bowman 1940:932-934). By the middle of the 19* century, the Narvaez family began to subdivide and sell portions of their land holdings. By the mid-1850's, the Rubino Property was situated within the northwest corner of the lands of John Quincy Pearl (Healy 1860)."

At the fair, U.S. displays provided an opportunity for middle-class Anglos to define their own story as the history of America.11 The exposition thus commemorated the birth of the white nation, while its vision of a unified America hid the massive racial and class conflicts which plagued the United States during the late nineteenth century. As the place where Anglo-Americans had declared their independence from England a century earlier, Philadelphia provided the perfect site for staging this vision; the city was, as organizers frequently declared, the ""nation's birthplace."" Having defined independence from England as the nation's originary moment, the exposition thus celebrated ""the first centennial of American freedom and national unity"" in 1876, the nation's 100th ""birthday. ""12","While the issue of how to define Americanness engendered some controversy among the exposition's racially homogeneous group of planners, when the exposition opened ""three ideas had already been identified with the national character: the Pioneer Spirit, Republicanism (incorporating democracy) and Progress."" These three themes subsequently served as signifiers of ""Americanness"" in each of the fairs of the following several decades.13 ""Progress,"" in fact, was the most fundamental theme of the exposition, the one that gave meaning to white America's history and institutions. At the fair, the development of industrial technology provided evidence of the nation's progress. The exposition itself opened on 10 May 11 Priscilla Wald writes that race was a crucial part of the process of constructing ""Americanness"" in legal terms as well.
