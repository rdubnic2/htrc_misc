They formerly owned the north-western half of the State of Illinois, and a large part of the State of Missouri. No Indian tribe, except the Sioux, has shown such daring intrepidity, and such implacable hatred towards other tribes. Their enmity, once excited, was never known to be appeased till the arrow and tomahawk had forever prostrated their foes. For centuries the prairies of Illinois and Iowa were the theatre of their exterminating prowess; and to them is to be attributed the almost entire destruction of the Missouris, the Illinois, Cahokias, Kaskaskias, and Peorias.","They were, however, steady and sincere in their friendship to the whites, and many is the honest old settler on the borders of their old dominion, who mentions with the warmest feelings the respectful treatment he has met with from them, while he cut the logs for his cabin and ploughed his “potato patch” on that lonely and unprotected frontier.

It would be to invite the scorn or the envy of their people, inasmuch as the influence of their headmen, and of the tribes as such, is exerted against such individual action on the part of any of their number, not to speak of the prejudice that prevails against the payment of the entry fees and commissions in such cases, which to the mind of the average Indian amounts to a purchase of the land. A further source of trouble in this connection is that growing out of the fact that even-numbered sections have been reserved for Indians within the limits of “railroad land grants."" In some instances their villages are found to be on railroad sections ; or, if they happen to be on reserved land, their little fields, cultivated all these years, are claimed as within the limits of the railroad grant, their improvements presenting such temptations as to overcome all considerations of sympathy and right. The lands are entered in the office of the railroad company, taken and occnpied, and the Indians turned out.","Now if the same rights which attach in common to the bona fide white settler occupying land prior to such grant to railroads were accorded to Indian occupants, it would be different; but, unfortunately for the Indian, he has not yet in fact come to be considered by the government as a man, although bearing the impress of a common Maker in all respects except as to the color of his skin. The situation, as far as it relates to the subject of lands, is anything but reassuring; and the correspondence with the department during the year, growing out of the anomalous situation of affairs at this agency, it is to be hoped, has developed the real needs of the Mission Indians in such a light as that the proper steps will soon be taken to provide them with suitable lands upon which they may gain a living. This is all that they ask of the government. Since my last report two schools have been established and conducted, for a period of nine months, with most gratifying results. Three more have been authorized, and by October 1 next will be in operation if the necessary preparations can be completed by that time."

These men are far more difficult to control than the Indians. Bringing as they do few of the virtues and all of the vices of civilized life, their presence is in no way desirable, but quite the reverse. Orders have been issued and posted in prominent places upon the opposite shore, that all who land upon the agency must at once report at the office; those not reporting to be sent at once withont the limits of the reservation. This has had a wholesome effect, and the number straggling has been diminished.","The better class of settlers approve the regulation; those whom it was intended to hit do not approve. I am bappy to be able to state that the police force among the Indians themselves is growing in favor. They see that it is a protection to them, and they are desirous that the force be increased. Quite recently a request was made by the headmen and chiefs that the police force be increased to fifty. When it is borne in mind that not more than two years since they were wholly and totally opposed to any police force at all, and that it was with great difficulty any men could be enlisted, the change in opinion in this matter seems quite remarkable."

And they naturally ask, “What profit will it be for us to build honses and plant fields if we too are to be compelled to fall back before the white stranger?” By giving them the land they now occupy, by extending over them the broad shield of the law, they are made legally equal with the whites. This done, they will enter upon such a career of improvement as this generation or any that have preceded it have never witnessed. As a measure of humanity and justice this great Nation cannot afford to refuse.","Give them the same rights, and at once they are placed side by side with the white settler who seeks to make a home for himself and his posterity.

Que further subject I would respectfully call.to the attention of the department, and close this long, and perhaps prolix, report. The duties, responsibilities, and cares of Indian agents are slightly understood outside of the circle in which they revolve. When it is borne in mind that they are isolated from home, and all its pleasures and comforts, from all they hold most dear; that they are charged frequently with the most delicate and onerons responsibilities; that upon their action peace or war may result, and that upon them, more than upon any other class, depends the success or failure of the question of the advancement of the Indian race, it would seem to be a measure of true economy that their services should meet with a corresponding reward. Like all men holding responsible positions, they are human; they may and will at times err, and the rules that in many cases would be applied to others will fail with them, and they cannot always perhaps be justly judged as other men may be.","Compelled to act at once, and often judge, court, and jury combined, deciding often against the white settler, squatter, or wood-chopper, they are censureil, in no small degree, because they thus decide. I think I may state without any contradiction, by any one qualified to judge, that an Indian agent who seeks to know and perform his duty will find but few waking hours when he will not be called upon to consider in what manner he can best perform the duties with which he is charged. His work is never done; be it midday or midnight, like the faithful soldier camped in the presence of the enemy, he must always be ready for action; ready to take advantage of any favorable movement; equally ready to repress any attempt at violence or insuborGination.

The fact that the power to so protect them has been intrusted to members of their own tribe has had more to do with the peace and tranquillity of this agency for the past as well as the two preceding years than anything else. Admit that the Indian is brutal in many ways and low in the evolutionary scale as a human being, but he is endowed with reasoning powers, and a conscience to a certain degree, and it would be strange indeed if he did not appreciate the trust and confidence that has been placed in him here, in placing the controlling and restraining power in the hands of the Indian police as Indians, and the entire removal from the vicinity of the agency of the white man's soldiers, whose presence appears to be a constant reminder that the Great Father, and the agent who represents him, are atraid to trust him. The abandonment of Camp Sheridan, Nebraska, located pineteen miles from here, last spring, thus leaving us with no troops nearer than sixty-three miles away at Fort Robinson, has thus far resulted in no injury to the interests of the agency, or the neighboring country, rather to the surprise of the stockmen and others, who as usual prognosticated Indian raids, outbreaks, &c. For the past year, no crime has been committed on the reserve, or disturbance created.","No stockman or settler in the neighboring State of Nebraska or the Black Hills can claim to have lost a head of stock, but rather the contrary, for many stray animals belonging to the stockmen have been picked up on the Irdians' land and returned to the rightful owners by the Indian police and individual Indians. During the past winter, more or less trouble was created by the introduction of intoxicating liquor from the whisky ranches established just over the Nebraska line, two miles from the agency, but the temporary establishing of two sub-stations for the police on the line, and a regular patrol of the same, resulted in the locking up of the offenders in the agency guard-house for several days at a time; and a prompt removal from the reserve of all white men found frequenting these ranches, very soon put a stop to one of the principal curses arising from the association of the Indian with the unprincipled class of whites too frequently to be found in the vicinity of Indian reservations. To thoroughly prevent the introduction of liquor into the Sioux country is a difficult matter. It is true the severe laws enacted by the United States to prevent this traffic should apparently put a stop to it, but when we consider that the noble red men as a people evince a remarkably natural taste for the article, it is not to be wondered at that they should shield the person who may attempt to supply them. This taste and desire for liquor appears not alone among the common Indians; it is not unwelcome to even Red Cloud (whom an editor of one of the philanthropical journals East recently very gushingly termed “the grand old chieftain ""), for excessive use of the fluid which exhilarates and at the same time intoxicates has had much to do with eliminating what grandeur formerly existed in this Indian, and has resulted in his downfall among his people."

Knowing that any real Indian attack could end only in massacre the people appealed to Reynolds for aid asking that he get men from South Carolina if necessary.48 Now here was a crisis which Reynolds, military man that he was, could cope with. He immediately raised a company of seventy rangers and prepared for defense.44 Yet the colony felt no great confidence for it realized that should the Creeks and the French attack in force it was doomed. Fortunately, before this could happen an Upper Creek chief, Oboylaco, came to Savannah and was received by Reynolds, his council and the assembly.45 He was in a belligerent mood and demanded satisfaction for the murder of the two Creeks, but Reynolds for once showed a flash of diplomacy, for he explained that in the fight two white men had also been killed and thus a life already had been given for a life, and no further satisfaction was due."

They accepted a small reservation in the southeastern Colorado sand hills. After three years of comparative quiet, the border was stirred up by a rather small complaint that through bungling became a serious incident. A settler reported to the officer at Camp Sanborn that some Indians had stolen cattle from him and his neighbor.

It was, however, greatly facilitated by David Landis, of Windon, a member of the Society for Pennsylvania Archaeology. Mr. Landis knew the location of most of the exposed pictographs, and we were able to begin work at once. The most important groups of writings were located a few miles above Safe Harbor on Walnut Island, which had received its name from a fine stand of walnut trees that had once flourished upon it. The cutting of the trees had exposed the soil of the island to erosion by winds and rains.","Subsequently, an early settler upon the island dug a race on the west side to a mill that he never built. That channel offered a ready passage for spring floods which tore away a considerable section of the side of the island and, possibly aided by previous erosion, brought to light the first ancient unknown writings seen by white men on the rocks thus exposed.  Petroglyphs made on Walnut Island during the first period of occupation. The inscriptions were brightened with chalk to make them readily discernible. It was decided to start work on Walnut Island with all possible dispatch as it was in the heart of the area to be covered by water."

Knowing Wetzel's habit of popping off an Indian and thinking afterward, if at all, the General looked with suspicion on this famous Indian fighter.

Many answers to this question were advanced, both in and out of government. Some suggested creating a geographic boundary, much as the British had done in 1763 when they designated a permanent frontier line along the Appalachians, so that Indians might maintain their accustomed way of life free from white encroachment. Others suggested that acculturation and assimilation of the Indians into the dominant society was the wisest course; although, as Brian W. Dippie suggested in The Vanishing American, “This gift of civilization—the ultimate gift, to the whites' way of thinking ... always seemed to please the donor more than the recipient.” And sufficient numbers of Americans, such as Montana Territorial Governor James M. Ashley, applauded extermination.","“The Indian race on this continent has never been anything but an unmitigated curse to civilization,” Ashley suggested in a letter he published in a national newspaper in 1870, ""while the intercourse between the Indian and the white man has been only evil (and will remain so] until the last savage is translated to that celestial hunting ground for which they all believe themselves so well fitted, and to which every settler on our frontier wishes them individually and collectively a safe and speedy transit.” | Suggestions, prudent and foolish, mean-spirited and generous, were offered in abundance because most Americans acknowledged that a solution to the Indian question was needed desperately. Generations of federal officials struggled to fashion a lasting one, even though the permanent resolution they sought remained elusive. Reflecting the exasperation this produced in generations of Americans, General William T. Sherman remarked to General John M. Schofield, “The whole Indian question is in such a snarl that I am utterly powerless to help you by order or advice.

Death from disease produced catastrophically higher figures, perhaps as high as 30 to 40 percent of their population, and even more among some tribes. “The vast preparations for the protection of the western frontier are superfluous,” one American wrote from New Orleans in 1838 following the Indian smallpox epidemic of that year.","“Another arm has undertaken the defense of the white inhabitants of the frontier; and the funeral torch, that lights the red man to his dreary grave, has become the auspicious star of the advancing settler.” Disease proved the most accurate and deadly harbinger of advancing white settlement to tribes. Perhaps worse even than epidemics was the introduction of alcohol on a scale that proved corrupting, demoralizing, and destructive to bodies and cultures not accustomed to it and its effects. “In epidemic form,” stated historian Bernard Sheehan, “it ravaged tribe after tribe until the drunken, reprobate Indian became a fixture of American folklore.” Studies in the 1970s postulated possible explanations for Indian drinking patterns, ranging from physiological causes (Jerry McLeod and Stanley Clark, “It's in the Blood,” Canadian Welfare, September-October 1974) to a method of protesting white domination (Nancy Oestrich Lurie, “The World's Oldest On-Going Protest Demonstration: North American Indian Drinking Patterns,” Pacific Historical Review, August 1971)."

In addition, the chapter fails to discuss the grounds upon which a state may exercise police power to regulate Indian fishing under the auspices of conservation. Review of cases in this area shows that the courts have favored the Indian entitlement in determining regulation for the purposes of conservation and have held that direct regulation of treaty Indian fishing in the interests of conservation is permissible only after the state has proved unable to preserve a run by forbidding the catching of fish by other citizens under its ordinary police power jurisdiction. (Antoine v. Washington, 420 U.S. 194, 95 S. Ct. 944, 952, 43 L. Ed. 2d 129, 1975) Apportionment of the right to fish has been subject to state regulation for purposes of conservation on the basis of treaty provisions which state that Indians may fish ""in common with"" other citizens at traditional grounds. The legal effect of this clause has been much disputed.","The state argues that the term ""in common with"" was intended merely to insure that the treaty Indians would not be treated discriminatorily, that each Indian should have access to the traditional fishing grounds on the same footing as each white settler. The Supreme Court long ago considered this construction, however, and rejected it. United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 379–82, 25 S. Ct. 662, 49 L. Ed. 1089 (1905). Thus, the concept of equitable adjustment of access to fishing comes into play, and the courts have upheld the Indians' entitlement to catch 50% not simply of the fish passing the traditional grounds, but also of those destined for those grounds but captured downstream or in marine waters.

Although Samuel Purchas thought the Virginia Indians little better than animals after the massacre of 1622, he nevertheless considered them “fit objects of zeale and pitie” for their very badness and savagery.” Images of the good and bad Indian proved as useful, therefore, to policy makers and others who wished to exploit Native American minds, bodies, or resources as they did to intellectuals and artists fighting the ideological controversies of European high culture at the time.","Beneath both the good and bad images used by explorer, settler, missionary, and policy maker alike lay the idea of Indian deficiency that assumed—even demanded—that Whites do something to or for Indians to raise them to European standards, whether for crass or idealistic motives.

The immigrant, whether German, Norwegian, or Bohemian, came from a situation in which 20 acres was a large farm and 160 acres was a kingdom. The plow, garden and cottage were his way of life."

Archaeological remains prove that they, also, lived in circular huts, probably of wigwam proportions, during the Ceramic-Woodland Age that preceded the coming of the whites. Nearly all early accounts of circular abodes represent them as being round-topped, including Champlain, 1604, who describes them as being relatively small with only a 10 to 15 foot diameter. G.H. Loskiel, 1794, describes the covering of rounded roofed wigwams with bark, for which basswood was preferred.

They cover their houses, laying the smooth side inwards, leaving an open space of about a foot wide in the crown, to let the smoke out. They lap the side edges and ends over each other, having regard to the shrinkage of the bark, securing the covering with withes to the lathings.""

Speaking of Huron cabins or garden arbors, it states: ""Some are covered with great pieces of ash bark, of elm, and of fir or spruce, and though those of cedar are the best, according to the most common advice and use, there is this inconvenience, that they are almost as susceptible to fire as matches ...""

The site of the ""cowboy massacre"" was in an area early and very heavily torn up by dam construction work and was never precisely located, much less excavated, for lack of timely research. Of course, there was never an assurance that it could have been so located. DAP research in military records has shown that the military did respond from Fort Lewis many times in the 1880's to protect the settlers — but not without realization of the typical overreaction syndrome of the Euro-American newcomers and some sympathy for the plight of the often inoffensive Ute and Navajo. After 1890, there was almost no further troublemaking between settlers and Indians in the DAP study area.","The earliest permanent settlers were, in any event, primarily cattle ranchers rather than farmers. Usage of the term has been remarkably persistent, so that even today farmers (who may own no livestock at all) are usually called ranchers.

One of the most prevalent means of contributing to one's livelihood was that of raising livestock. Stock raising was considered as profitable as any other business and more so than many, but it required much work. Raising of cattle was not my major interest although I had some, chiefly for beef and butter purposes. I was not at all a “cattleman,” although I might have been a few years later when that day arrived had I been living in typical cattle country."

Horses grazed mostly along the Brazos, Steel's Creek, Duffau Creek, etc., which lie north of the main Bosque River. And while we did not consider ourselves ranchmen, in the latter sense, we broke our stock to work and to saddle. Several years' experience in the saddle, almost daily, soon enabled a man to become somewhat accustomed to that seat even on a pitching horse. Horses on the range became wild and spirited and about one out of five horses gave real trouble in “breaking,” but it was all a part of the horseman's work.","We tried to raise good saddle horses for the pleasure afforded by satisfactory transportation and because I always considered the best horses obtainable in a country subject to invasion by the Indians a part of the settler's fundamental equipment. Naturally we expected to market the surplus. A man's life frequently depended on the speed, stamina, and intelligence of his horse. I remember that one of my favorite saddlers was a high-spirited stallion named Blackleg, while another which I felt could carry me away from a party of redskins was named Blue Dog. One high-strung and fast animal that I liked to ride had some mustang blood in her and would buck frequently with me on cool mornings."

Sometimes Indian raids delayed us in getting to this part of our farming and much of the grain was lost. But we worked desperately to save what we could, once we got to it, and neighbors frequently assisted each other.","The scythe and cradle were in general use, although there was an occasional settler who cut with horse power. Then it was hauled in near the house and stacked in preparation for threshing. Potatoes, of course, were hauled to the houses and banked to preserve.

In addition to his own house of logs, or of logs and clapboards, there were the houses for the negroes, the smokehouse, the cribs, etc. Rafters and laths were obtained from the timber at hand as well as the logs for the walls. Doors were heavy but practicable in a country invaded by Indians and were constructed with the usual bars and notches.

The stock were then sold for much higher prices than the ranchers had paid for them (Osgood 1929). The Mormons had similar practices and made great profits from buying goods at low prices from traders who needed cash as they passed through on their way to California and other frontiers (Fite 1966).

The early ditch-building projects in the area never got beyond the stage of individual ditches built to benefit individual ranch requirements. Later, ranches expanded these systems and took water from the early ditches. But truly community-wide irrigation projects were never initiated, and this affected the integration of the community. Instead of having equality in water ownerships, the water ownerships are ranked by individual priorities based on dates of appropriation and adjudication.","Because the most important consideration for the early Sidney Jocknick was an early settler who contributed considerable knowledge about early adaptations. He had been a Ute Agency employee, miner, cowboy, and store clerk, among other occupations. The Jocknick family presence in the area at Cow Creek was probably related to the past occupation of Sidney's father, Captain G.F. Jocknick, who was retired from 11 years of service in the Indian Department and 13 years of military service before immigrating to Ouray in 1877 (Ouray Times 23 June 1877). Coal mining and wood cutting were among early activities to acquire capital or to supplement income. Among the early coal miners was Major Call, who in 1883, sold locally acquired coal at prices less than half the cost of coal from Crested Butte (Wood and Wood 1977)."

There is no general prohibition in consequence of the treaty of the freedom of the Indian in roaming and hunting over the country. Of course when settlement advances there will be the restriction which necessarily follows, and it is to meet such contingencies that reserves are set aside. 82 Sifton was indicating that the Indians of Treaty Eight would be subject to the same legal restrictions as Indians of previous treaties, but that the effect of these restrictions would be minimal, due to less white settlement.","In reply to another inquiry, David Laird, lieutenant governor of the Territories and Treaty Eight commissioner, also indicated that restrictions would be necessary, not so much as a result of settlement as for conservation for the Indians' benefit: You may explain to them that the Queen or Great Mother while promising by her Commissioners to give them Reserves, which they can call their own, and upon which whitemen will not be allowed to settle without payment and the consent of the Indians before a Government officer, yet the Indians will be allowed to hunt and fish all over the country as they do now, subject to such laws as may be made for the protection of game and fish in the breeding season; and also so long as the Indians do not molest or interfere with settlers, miners or travellers.

It should likewise be remembered that laws for preventing game from being destroyed in the breeding season are rather for the benefit of the Indians than of the whitemen, as the whitemen live more on farm products than on ---game. 83 -----------During this period between the summer of 1898, when the treaty notice came out, and the following summer, when the treaty was made, the Indians made it quite clear (through missionaries, traders, and policemen who acted as intermediaries) that they would not favour a treaty unless they were assured that their way of life would not be restricted."

The Chattahoochee valley artifact is historically symbolic for more than its materials, colors, or pattern. The last days before the migration of the Creek Indians and the fading of the Federal Road were marked also by an interweaving of the forces and the people that played prominent roles in the transformation of western Georgia and Alabama. Familiar elements in a struggle dating at least from the opening of the horse path in 1806 reappear to complete the design: tensions between Creek factions and between whites and Indians generally; the conflict over national and states' rights: the peace treaties that brought war; the claims to land entitlements that brought bloodshed and lawsuits; a standing cast of characters—Andrew Jackson, Little Prince, Big Warrior, Menawa, William and Chilly McIntosh, William Walker, David Moniac, Jere Austill, Matthew Arbuckle, and Edmund P. Gaines; and the Federal Road itself, with all of its ruts, swamps, and sandbeds, still the agent of intrusion. To be sure, other factors, political, economic, and technological, also figured in the disappearance of the Federal Road as the nineteenth century progressed, but none was as important as the removal of the Indians."

Dickinson, who had been captured in his youth and raised by the Delawares, told a more recent English captive about one of his exploits against the English colonists in the 1760s. While approaching the English frontier, Dickinson spied a colonist stalking a deer. He quickly shot and scalped the fellow, when “an old man, whom he supposed to be the father of the man he had killed, came running toward him, hallooing at him if he had killed the deer.”","Instead of his son, the old settler found Dickinson, who, waving the scalp, answered in English, “Yes, by G-d, and if you don't believe me here is the skin. ”36 The dehumanization of the enemy is a feature shared by many, perhaps most cultures; among the Eastern Woodlands Indians it resonated in particular tones with features of a cosmology that did not elevate humanity above other creatures. Enemies lay roughly parallel to animals in the eighteenth-century Eastern Woodlands classification: they could be killed, yet the act commanded ritual attention. When a respected Shawnee woman examined a new group of prisoners, and praised the warriors for bringing in “good meat,” she spoke not in creative metaphor, but in the idiom of her people."

As the party of neutral accommodation, headed by Attakullaculla, Oconostota, and the Raven, listened to the warriors sing the northerners' war song, it knew that it was hearing a vote of no confidence.

In his justification for the project, Libby noted that a ""large number of professional and highly trained men and women on relief"" could be employed to do the work, ""to the great benefit of the state.""” A fortuitous and fortunate set of circumstances made work-relief projects such as the Historical Records Survey and the Historical Data Project possible. By the early 1930s the archival discipline had developed to the point where local, state, and federal officials were aware that public records should be preserved and made accessible."

Most important, however, was that projects such as the Historical Data Project were apparently ideally suited to the skills of the whitecollared unemployed who were on the relief rolls. Project promoters assumed, mistakenly, as it turned out, that the techniques necessary for this kind of work were so elementary that almost anyone who could comprehend simple instructions could do the work, with a modicum of training and supervision.” Because work-relief projects, except those sponsored by the federal government, had to be initiated by a local sponsor, the Historical Data Project was sponsored by the State Historical Society. The Project's purpose was to locate and collect materials vital to preserving the record of the state's early years.","Included would be information on early settlers, post offices, schools, towns, immigrant colonies, trails, stage lines, military roads, and mail routes. Also to be included were old newspapers, diaries, letters, local government records, pioneer farm implements, hand-made tools, kitchen utensils, and Indian artifacts. Once gathered, the materials and artifacts were to be deposited with the State Historical Society where they would be indexed and cross-referenced and made available to those who would subsequently write the history of the state and its cities and counties. Another primary objective of the Historical Data Project was to obtain information from which to write a biography of every pioneer in the state. The project proposal's language reflects this ambitious aspect: The history of a state is compiled from original sources."

McKenzie County was organized in 1905; Adams, Bowman, Hettinger, and Mercer counties in 1907; Dunn and Sheridan counties in 1908; and Divide County in 1910. Grant County, the last in the state to be organized, was not organized until November 25, 1916. In such counties, all those who had filed on homesteads during the first year that filing was permitted were counted as pioneers.","Even this exception was not altogether satisfactory, however, because not every early settler had homesteaded.

Martin 1991:260-68). In May 1681, Waban's name headed a petition from twenty-two men from Natick and two other Indian enclaves that demanded compensation for Nipmuc lands. Over the next two years they would contest bitterly a string of land sales made by a Nipmuc, John Wampus, who apparently had betrayed his position as the Indians' interpreter to sell large chunks of the territory (Indian Records [30]:257-58, 260a, 262a, 265, in Massachusetts Archives; NPNER [5]: 364). After Waban's death, a very different controversy emerged over the then-empty praying towns, particularly Okommakamesit, which adjoined the English town of Marlborough. In 1682 Waban, along with a few other Natick Indians, had claimed exclusive rights to the reserve, and his son Thomas was to inherit that claim along with his authority.","The other Natick leaders apparently planned to see the plantation resettled by some of their people, for rather than selling the town, they arranged for a settler to build a sawmill within its bounds (Indian Records [30]:267—68, in Massachusetts Archives; NPNER [5]:355). Thomas Waban, however, had very different ideas, and his actions would bring temporary disgrace. Thomas Emerges Waban died in about 1684, less than ten years after having led his people back to Natick (Indian Records [30]:267—68, in Massachusetts Archives; Middlesex County Deeds [9]: 102). Thomas, not only Waban's eldest son but also the grandson of the Nashoba sachem, soon inherited his father's mantle of leadership in the village.

Born as the Puritans settled at Massachusetts Bay, as a young man he was sent by his father and John Eliot to live and be educated among the English. While much of his life during the subsequent half-century remains a mystery, no doubt he experienced many of the traumas of his compatriots: imprisonment and service in King Philip's War, resettlement in Natick, and re-establishment of many aboriginal ways on the new frontier. Upon Waban's death, Thomas overcame an initial misstep to become one of the community's leaders. But Thomas held less authority than his father, perhaps because he lacked charisma or political acumen, or (more likely) because postwar conditions had altered the structure and nature of power in Natick.","As a growing number of English settlers surrounded Natick, he helped guide the town through the adoption of a New England polity, the Magunkaquog sale, landholding in severalty, and the traumatic loss of two outstanding native ministers—all the time maintaining the community's essential autonomy.

The arrival of the English minister may have seemed a disturbing alteration, but Thomas had little time left to contemplate this threat. Thomas Waban died in 1722, leaving a will—an unusual document for an Indian, and one that highlights how far Thomas had moved from his illiterate, ""propertyless"" father, although this was a change that Waban had set in motion. Most of Thomas's real estate went to his younger son, Isaac, including his thirty-five acre house lot, the use of the house on the lot, his orchards, and two acres of meadowland."

(Sanborn 1917: 205-06) If the epic potential of American prehistory marked one pole of significance for aboriginal remains in the early republic, the other pole of significance was deeply personal: re-enactment through display of intuition, opportunity to demonstrate possession of that “indigenous mental geognosy” of which Schoolcraft spoke-in short, the chance to “play Indian.” The charm of the Thoreau anecdote lies precisely in his boyish ego: he displays his ""Indianness,"" and thus his essential Americanness, by digging beneath the surface of the present to expose the Indian past, and show off the result to equally boyish admirers (proving that he had been right in his conjecture”)-including, not incidentally, Sanborn, who preserves and narrates the story. James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking retraces ancient trails; Daniel Boone intuits his way home, Indian-like, through miles of dense forest; anthropologist Frank Hamilton Cushing, exploring southern Arizona in 1887, claims to be able to sense the remains of ancient dwellings under the earth, instructing his Mexican workers exactly where to dig for architectural outlines; and another century later, American Way Magazine (November, 1989) features Stanford anthropology professor John Rick, an “Achiever,” who is pictured sitting ""with son Matthew” at Zuni pueblo, “an important archaeological excavation site,"" practicing prehistoric stone toolmaking.","And so it goes: American history and literature have been populated from the beginning by intermediary figures who undergo a wilderness quest and return to enrich and regenerate their settler culture with aboriginal knowledge (Slotkin 1974). The distinctive character of the dig-as-quest lies in its mimetic quality=""thinking like an Indian,” knowing where to look and most particularly in the presumed knowledge, or re-knowing, of place. It seems to be, too, largely a male quest: father to son, brother to brother, mentor to student, digging up aboriginal America contributed to (if it did not specifically create) a shared male identity that, one might suggest, went through the earth (and its inhabitants). From George Wharton James' What We Can Learn from the Indians to the YMCA's father-son Indian Guides program of the 1950s and, perennially, the Boy Scouts of America, the (imagined) Indian of the past has served as resource for far more than iconic or metaphorical purposes.

The deeds reflect a pattern in the relationships between the two cultures which resulted in the strengthening of the sachems' powers over their followers. Penhawis and Cakapeteyno were undoubtedly men of high status in their communities and the seven “owners” were probably local village headmen who had acknowledged the temporary authority of the sachems. The following year, about a month after the massacre of the Pequots by the English, the Dutch negotiated another deed with Penhawis and Cakapeteyno, who are identified this time as “owners” rather than chiefs. The two men said that they had the consent of the community of Keshaechquereren to sell for trade goods the island called Pagganack (Governors Island) and a tract of land called “Rinnegaconck,” on the southwest side of Wallabout Bay (Appendix B-2 and B-3; NYCD 14:4).","Rinnegaconck was purchased for George Rapalje, the Walloon settler, perhaps to clear up any question about his land title.

This line of argument clearly indicated that Miantonomi had no intention of organizing a conspiracy against the English and raises serious questions about the credibility of other aspects of Gardiner's account.

In seeing cultures as dynamic and ever changing, I am intrigued by the ways in which ideas travel and, in many cases, are translated within and between societies. In his linguistic model of hybridity, Mikhail Bakhtin describes how in a hybrid construction an ""utterance . . . actually contains mixed within it two utterances, two speech manners, two styles, two 'languages,' two semantic and axiological belief systems"" (The Dialogic Imagination 304). Bakhtin further explains how even ""the same word will belong simultaneously to two languages, two belief systems that intersect in a hybrid construction—and the word has two contradictory meanings, two accents"" (305).","While Bakhtin is describing how an utterance can contain two belief systems, two languages, I am interested in how the writers addressed in the following pages create dialogic narratives in which American Indians now re-configure settler colonial discourse.

Creative literary hybridity unsettles the authority of the colonizers and their language and discourse. Whereas Bakhtin distinguishes between the process of merging (organic hybrid) and the process of dialogizing (intentional hybrid), I concur with Stuart Hall's observation that these are ""two phases of the same movement"" (""New Ethnicities"" 252). Hybridity is simultaneously ""'organically' hegemonizing, creating new spaces, structures, scenes, and 'intentionally' diasporizing, intervening as a form of subversion, translation, transformation"" (Young 25)."

As Wendy Rose explains, ""Ours is always the balancing act between selling and selling out"" (413). Another recourse is to submit work to one of the presses that either is owned and operated by American Indian people or is committed to American Indian Literature. A major disadvantage for American Indian writers is that they have often been alienated from their culture(s), and writing in English—the language of the dominant power and discourse— exacerbates this. Some concepts are distorted when translated while others are untranslatable.","Language is also one of the main tools that settler society uses to indoctrinate the colonized subject. Correct, standard English (capital E) is validated and any deviations from this—speaking ""Indian,"" use of the vernacular, or hybridized speech—is often not only invalidated as inauthentic, ""incorrect"" but also, in the colonial discourse, equated with inferiority. Language becomes a representation and further codification and inscription of value judgments and of power imbalances. Those who deviate from the ""correct"" usage are devalued and marginalized. The extreme effect of this destructive process occurs when the marginalized subject is shamed into silence, into a position of negation and absence."

By viewing subversive mimicry as a dialogue, a contestation as well as a re-imagination of existing power relations, writers can experiment with dialogic narrative practices that challenge the colonial notion that contact between cultures is a one-way process—the imposition of one culture over another. Instead, such narrative practices foreground contact between different cultures as ongoing processes of cultural exchanges. Dialogic narrative strategies enable writers to present exchanges in which cultural differences remain heterogeneous while at the same time mapping out a terrain in which readers can bridge, not eliminate, cultural differences. Since power relationships are ever shifting, American Indian authors can present multiple positions while still addressing the power imbalance evident in the colonial relationship between colonizer and colonized.","In Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony, for instance, the author illustrates how the colonized can define community to resist settlers.

Gunn Allen argues that chronological time structuring promotes and sustains settler industrialism. In addition, it reinforces the settler ideological validation of individualism and this, she says, ""contrasts sharply with a ceremonial time sense that assumes the individual as a moving event shaped by and shaping human and nonhuman surroundings"" (149).

Here, the ducks are not discovered; instead, they transform themselves into Indians, and are agents of their own subjectivity (79). Through the play of multiple voices, King replaces the concept of a single, authoritative narrative/history with an alternative paradigm of dynamic multiplicity that positions itself neither in relation to nor in opposition to a colonial hegemonic center.18 In places, the narratives are self-referential; they alert readers to the ways stories and histories are cultural constructions. At one point, the narrator steps outside the story to comment on Coyote to the audience: ""Well, that Coyote don't know what to do."

This story is doing just fine. This story knows where it is going. Sit down. Keep your skin on"" (72).","In this way, King contrasts the grandmother's narrative with the settlers' and implies that this story has a life of its own; the story has its own knowledge. However, the context in which King presents this statement points to the indeterminacy of knowledge. He encourages us to question whether this, or any, story can know, or ever claim to know. The participatory interaction between tellers, both in the frame tale between Coyote and grandmother and in the inner tales about Coyote, destabilizes the centrality and closure in many eurocentric narratives. Similarly, the first ending (the ending to the inner tales) refuses closure because it circles back to the beginning."

The speaker must consider not only how and what s/he presents but also the audience to whom s/he is speaking. The audience often participates in the story, helping to shape and determine it. There is a colonial assumption that narratives that draw heavily on American Indian traditions of storytelling are relics or reproductions of dead or dying cultures—museum artifacts of limited impact and import.","King's work contradicts this assumption because he demonstrates that such narratives are capable of great power, sophistication, and contemporary relevance to American Indian and settler readers. As Walter J. Ong points out, ""narrative originality lodges not in making up new stories but in managing a particular interaction with this audience at this time—at every telling the story has to be introduced uniquely into a unique situation, for in oral cultures an audience must be brought to respond, often vigorously"" (42).

In another half century, in one of the most remarkable achievements of the American pioneering spirit, their descendants would move across a continent, from the Alleghenies to the Pacific Ocean. In October, 1758, the Treaty of Easton (Pennsylvania) was negotiated by British Indian agent George Croghan, at the same time that General John Forbes was marching his massive army over the mountains and through the Pennsylvania wilderness toward the French Fort Duquesne at the Forks of the Ohio. At Easton, Croghan, with the blessings of the English ministries, was able to convince the Indians that the land west of the mountains was to be Indian Land Forever, even though the King's Proclamation Line, which would proscribe white settlement west of the central ridge of the Appalachian Mountains, was still five years in the future. At the time it made little difference; in the century and a half since 1607 the white man had crossed that mountain range only to peek at what was beyond before scurrying back to the safety of the Atlantic coast.","Rare indeed was the English settler who would dare cross the mountains to live in a wilderness surrounded by wild Indians.

Therefore, in order to prevent future wars involving the Indian nations, a line, the King's Proclamation Line of 1763, was established along the crest of the Appalachians, west of which no settlement by the English colonists was to be allowed.

About thirty young men, among them Andrew Zane of Wheeling, collected at the mouth of Grave Creek, a dozen miles below Wheeling. Upon reaching their destination, the future site of Harrodburg, Kentucky, they began clearing the land and making improvements. By June they had completed some forty cabins, and considerable fields of corn had been planted. In the memorable month of April, 1774, a full year before the shot heard 'round the world was fired, several events occurred along the Ohio that were to prove to be of as great a consequence for the future of the country, although they no longer claim the attention given to those skirmishes in Massachusetts."

In the fall of 1775 he set out once more, this time with Thomas Williams as his companion. While hunting at the Blue Licks they first heard of other white men in the country, and of the settlements made by Boone, Harrod, and Hinkston (afterwards becoming Ruddle's Station). They spent the remainder of the winter visiting from one fort to another, finally settling at Hinkston's.

There could hardly have been a more dangerous occupation. In order to avoid scaring the game it was necessary for the hunter to go alone. When the game was sighted and approached, it could easily enough be brought down with a ball from the hunter's rifle."

In surveying the history of the last ten thousand years of Creek religion, it is fair to say that at least four major religious transformations have occurred. The first transformation took place three thousand years ago when hunter-gatherers in the Southeast began cultivating domesticated crops and adopted a settled way of existence. The second transformation occurred a little more than a thousand years ago as Creek ancestors involved themselves in the “Mississippian” cultural complex. The third occurred when that complex civilization collapsed and the Creeks became participants in a new colonial order of transatlantic, multinational trade (1540-1812).","The fourth took place when the Creeks were displaced from their ancestral homelands by settler occupations and an American military invasion, and then forced by U.S. army to “remove"" west to Oklahoma (1813–38). With each major transformation, Creeks altered their religious formation, making it distinct from what had preceded it, yet clearly dependent upon the past for key symbols, rites, and values. In what follows, I will refer to these as the Woodland, Mississippian, the classic Creek, and the modern Creek religious formations, respectively. Before proceeding, however, an important methodological point must be made. By relating religious change to changes in subsistence, politics, economics, and landscape, I do not mean to imply that changes in Creek religion were caused by nonreligious forces or secular events."

ANDREWS One day in 1866, Luis Rafael Trujillo asked his father, Atanasio, a simple question. He wanted to know who was the first nuevomexicano to colonize Colorado's San Luis Valley, an arid plain the size of Connecticut nestled at over 7,000 feet above sea level between the San Juan, Cochetopa, and Sangre de Cristo mountain ranges. The father, sixty-five years old but still full of life, answered laconically, referring to himself in the third-person: “Atanasio Trujillo, interpreter of the Ute Indians and guardian of the Utes and the Spanish Americans.” It was a terse but revealing reply:","Atanasio considered himself the first settler of the San Luis Valley; he was fluent enough in both the Ute and Spanish languages to translate between them; and, he played the intriguing role of “guardian” to Utes and nuevomexicanos alike.3 Atanasio's response said too much too quickly, however, only provoking more questions in his son's mind. Armed with pen and paper to record his father's tale, Luis Rafael wanted the whole story, not just a single riddle-filled sentence. From thirty-nine years' experience with his father, he knew that the man fellow villagers called “Tata” (a northern nuevomexicano term of respect and affection) had more to say. Trying to draw out the loquacious storyteller, Luis Rafael asked a second question: ""In what year did Atanasio Trujillo come to the Rio Conejos?” (referring to a river that flows out of the San Juans through the San Luis Valley to join the Rio Grande)."
