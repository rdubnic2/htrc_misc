There are still two Cherokee dialects extant,the Western (often called “Upper"") dialect, spoken by the majority of the Cherokee in Oklahoma and by a few families in Graham County, N. C., and the Central (often called “Middle"") dialect, spoken by the Cherokee on the Qualla Reservation, where these investigations were made. There is historic evidence of a third dialect, which may be called the Eastern (it has sometimes been referred to as the “Lower'') dialect; the last Indian, as far as we know, who spoke this dialect died in the beginning of this century.

There are, however, indications that until recently (15 to 20 years ago) formulas were sold to a layman by a medicine man, if the former were willing to pay the price for it.

A plausible reason for the popularity of the two kinds mentioned before seems to my mind to be that an individual wanted to buy love or hunting formulas mainly so as to be able to go through the necessary ritual and ceremonies without the aid of a medicine man; by acting alone he could keep his intentions and his plans in the domain of hunting and love a secret to eventual competitors. There are some formulas, however, which a medicine man will not communicate to an uninitiated member of the tribe at any price.

All daily activities were strung on an invisible chain of prayer, “conveyed in the design of woven fabrics, in beadwork, pottery and decoration of all kinds, in dance, in ceremony and in song.” There was elemental truth in such a religion. A missionary now in his thirtieth year of service on an Indian field, says of it that ""it was a religious searching after the Eternal Verities.”","For a good many reasons the Indian's heritage of beauty has become nearly extinct under the overlay of civilization that has rushed upon him.

Measuring the scale of prehistoric human impact in North America is something we are only just now beginning to grapple with. For my doctoral thesis at the University of Sheffield, England, I studied the remains of freshwater mussels from shell midden sites over a large part of the southeastern United States.","Many species of mussel are today either extinct or on the verge of extinction. Biologists attribute this decline to water pollution, among other things. The only real form of water pollution in prehistoric times was siltation, the washing of soil from disturbed land into rivers and streams. When I examined the prehistoric mussel remains, I found that the species known to be most sensitive to pollution today began to decline in numbers as much as five thousand years ago, and that the rate of decline increased as Indians in the region adopted agriculture as a way of life. This appears to be a measurable effect of erosion resulting from Indian land use."

California's oldest definite archaeological materials are assigned to the Fluted Point Tradition. Most finds consist of isolated specimens or surface scatters of fluted projectile points. These artifacts closely resemble Clovis points from the American Southwest which have been dated to between 10,000 and 9000 B.C.

The occurrence of fluted points in coastal, valley, montane, and lakeshore settings, coupled with the diversity of associated stone tools, implies that the prehistoric people of the area led a generalized huntinggathering way of life. It has been possible, using the historical linguistic and archaeological data, to reconstruct a hypothetical model of California Indian language spreads. At about 6000 B.C., California probably included just two, Hokan and Yukian.

It may be regulated by forming colonies under the direction of the government and by posting a body of troops to execute their orders. As population shall increase and approach the Indian boundaries, game will be diminished and new purchases may be made for small considerations.

Both of these examples are dramatically narrowed feeding specializations that originated with intermediate feeding specializations: Seeking prey on flowers, or seeking prey as external parasites on hosts. Provided the benefits of such a change outweigh the costs, the transition to feeding exclusively on pollen or nectar or blood would promote resource partitioning in the ecosystem and facilitate the origin of distinctive species from more generalized ancestors. Bats that feed mainly on flowers have remarkable specializations: Long, protrusible tongue, tubular snout, specialized night vision for locating flowers, ability to hover as they feed on flowers, and special digestive modifications. Similarly, vampire bats have elongated canine teeth for cutting into the flesh of their prey and digestive adaptations for processing blood and flesh; one genus of bats is specialized for gaffing fish as they skim water, with elongate, curved claws on the rear feet that snag prey.","Among extinct animals such transitions are much more difficult to examine, but they can be inferred nevertheless.

To prevent this, and at the same time to ameliorate the condition of the Indians, the good Fathers of the Mission of Santa Barbara conceived the idea of removing them to the mainland, where they might be watched over, improved, and preserved, under their immediate superintendance, For this purpose they visited the islands, in company with a few partially civilized Indians, and explained to them the advantages of removing to the Mission. They listened attentively to the proposal, and finally consented to go, on promises of protection from their natural enemies being given by the Fathers."

At the end of August Doctor Roberts went to Pecos, N.

All these tribes made their rendezvous in the Flathead country, and moved from there eastward, northward, and southward for buffalo hunting in three or more large parties, keeping more or less in touch with one another during their travels. Being equal in numbers, and superior in horses and weapons to most parties of the Plains Indians, they had little difficulty in holding their own.","These conditions continued until the buffalo became nearly extinct. The Coeur d'Alene generally went with the Spokan, and both often with the Kalispel and Pend d'Oreilles. Sometimes part of them went with the Flathead, and at other times with the Nez Perce. Most fighting occurred with the Blackfoot, who were considered the worst enemies of the Salish tribes, but also with the Crow, and in later days with the Sioux. The Snake, Bannock, and Lite were almost always friendly with the Salish tribes, and were aligned with them against the eastern tribes."

As we know today, his conclusions were faulty, mainly because of the absence of comparative data against which he could weigh his own findings. This was not through any fault of his own.","Swept away by imagination, and in keeping with the illusory views of his contemporaries, he concluded that the peoples who had constructed the tumuli were “moundbuilders,” an older, more mysterious people who were more advanced in their culture than the contemporary American Indian but were now extinct. Between 1845 and 1847 another and more comprehensive study of the mound region was undertaken by two investigators whose work was to be cited for years to come by American historians. Dr. E. H. Davis, a physician living at Chillicothe, Ohio, and his associate, E. G. Squier, inaugurated an intensive survey and excavational project and arranged for the Smithsonian Institution to publish their findings under the title Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. Theirs was the first study of the geographical distribution of the mounds, and they also attempted to classify the mounds according to what they believed were their original uses. Squier and Davis maintained that some of the mounds had served as fortifications while others had been used as burial sepulchres, temple foundations, and as effigies for native ceremonial rites."

With only spears, darts, and later, bows and arrows, the hunters had a difficult time bringing down these huge, tough animals in open country. Their most effective hunting method was fire, used to stampede the animals over a cliff or into a ravine. A marked change in climate about 25,000 years ago melted the ice sheet in the middle west, exposing large new areas of pasture land. As the pasture increased, for some unknown reason all the species of larger buffalo died off, leaving the open country to be occupied by the smaller buffalo of modern times, which came up from Mexico to fill the empty spaces."

There is some question whether the B. taylori and the B. occidentalis are not actually the same species.,"At any rate, they are closely related and are considered to be extinct, although some geographers believe it is possible that the extant wood buffalo in northern Alberta is actually the B. occidentalis. Wood buffalo have been protected for nearly a century and the herd has increased during that period, but it is probable that they have crossbred with the plains buffalo for the last sixty years. Hence it is considered impossible to secure an animal known to be a specimen of the true wood buffalo that could be compared in detail with the skeletons of the B. taylori from the Folsom kill and the B. occidentalis from the Big Sandy Creek kill. During the period when many species of large grass-eaters were destroyed, the modern bison was common in Mexico, as shown by the many fossil remains. It is possible that the conditions that killed off the animals on the plains did not occur in Mexico, or perhaps the Mexican bison had a biological edge that enabled it to survive."

These environmental factors favored the spread of lush grasslands, which attracted herds of large grazing animals such as mammoth, camel, horse, and bison. In turn, they lured Paleo-Indian hunters, who apparently drifted westward from the mid-continent prairies. Because they roamed over terrain that is now eastern New Mexico, these first southwestern big game hunters have been named Clovis, after remains found near the town of Clovis.","Clovis culture appeared during a brief time when the mammoth, an extinct elephant, was the preferred prey of the Paleo-Indian. Consistently in archeological finds the remains of one or more mammoths are associated with a group of implements that invariably includes a characteristic fluted point and several kinds of knives fashioned from flakes of stone. The long, leaf-shaped Clovis points, with rudimentary flakes struck from their sides, once tipped spears that were used in dispatching the huge beasts. The knives were used to butcher them. The inequalities in size and strength between the men and their quarry were partially compensated for by use of a notched throwing stick, known as an atlatl, that provided extra leverage in propelling the spear."

Other than their basic quest for food, their tools, and a presumed informal small band organization, nothing is known about the Clovis men. By approximately 8500 B.C. unfavorable environmental conditions in the western Southwest had doomed the grazing animals, except the bison. Consequently, their pursuers slowly retreated eastward to happier hunting grounds.

Núñez himself said of them that “they have no settled abodes,” and he records one shift of thirty leagues, and another of eleven days' travel, with different tribes.

While the big game hunters always led a nomadic life, those who lived by fishing were settled to a very high degree. Far-reaching climatic changes seem to have taken place on the American continent in about 7000 BC and these might account for the fact that the big game died out. The big game hunters either turned to gathering plants and small game or died out altogether and were succeeded by other peoples who were already living by these means. These severe climatic changes may have provided the incentive in vast areas of America for seeking new forms of nourishment and there is no doubt that this was largely responsible for the development of agriculture."

Although this probably constitutes a record for a one-crop diet, maize also is the most valuable crop produced in the United States and is an important grain crop in certain parts of Europe and Asia. The origin of this cereal remains a mystery, the solution of which would contribute to the vexing question of the antiquity of man in America and might aid in determining the relationship of the North and South American civilizations, to say nothing of being of interest to plant breeders and geneticists. Most botanists are agreed that the grass, Euchlaena mexicana Schrad., usually known by the Aztec name “teosinte,” is definitely associated with the origin of maize.

Irrespective of which one or combination of the above theories of the origin of maize eventually proves to be true, the distribution of teosinte as a wild plant is of importance in delimiting the area in which maize may have originated. The distribution of maize itself is too extensive and too certainly determined by man to be of much value in settling its place of origin. а HISTORY The history of teosinte is involved chiefly because the early observers did not always distinguish this grass from members of the related genus, Tripsacum."

This process led to the formation of Glacial Lakes Peace, Tyrrell and Edmonton in the north-central and northern parts of the province (Taylor 1961). St. Onge (1972) refined this picture and showed that what was formerly termed Glacial Lake Edmonton was in reality a series of overlapping lakes of different elevations which had various outlets in different time periods. Radiocarbon dates from this work suggest that ice retreat was rapid and that periglacial conditions did not play an important role in creating the present relief of north central Alberta. At the end of the last glaciation, termed the Wisconsin, areas of both southern and north-central Alberta were occupied by an exotic fauna.","In the eastern Peace River District of Alberta, Churcher and Wilson (1979) have recovered fossil remains of woolly mammoth, species of horse, a camel, elk, musk-ox and extinct as well as modern forms of bison. Ritchie (1976) has attempted to provide a general account of the environment in which these animals lived. His work involved the construction of a vegetation history for the western interior of Canada based on 16 representative pollen cores in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. From his interpretation, it appears that an early version of the boreal forest, composed mainly of spruce and lacking pine, spread into Canada from the adjacent United States on to deglaciated surfaces and even on to till over stagnant ice. In the southern portions of the prairie provinces, this forest persisted until about 10,000 years ago, while in the northern portions of the prairie provinces, it lasted until 6,000 years ago."

These same worked stones—in other countries always of flint, but in New Jersey of argillite, a slate-like stone that has been altered by heat, and possesses now a conchoidal fracture—these occur in the Delaware gravels; and the vivid pictures of glacial time, with primitive man a prominent feature thereof, that have been given by Wright, Wilson, Haynes, McGee, Upham, Cresson, Babbitt, and others, are doubtless familiar to all readers of recent scientific literature.

I recalled, as I walked, what the geologists have recorded of the river's history, and it was no wild whim of the unchecked imagination to picture the Delaware as a still more firmly frozen stream; so firmly ice-bound, indeed, that the mastodon might pass in safety over it—not cautiously, even, but with the quick trot of the angry elephant—and picture still further a terrorstricken Stone-age hunter fleeing for his life."

The nearer relation of man with the oldthan with the new-world primates, the many discoveries of prehistoric races in Europe and contiguous countries, and traditions together, render it probable that he had his origin in the old world and migrated elsewhere.

I confess that I belong to the former class, and that I am impressed by certain fragments of evidence which we possess, though chiefly by the following more general considerations. During the early Pleistocene period, when we begin to find the first positive evidence of man in Europe, America, Asia, and Europe still formed one great continent, with a temperate climate in the northern portions, because the broad land ridge between America and Asia shut out the Arctic current, and the northern Pacific region was favored by what is now known as the Japanese Current. In this period there culminated the great interchange of mammalian life between America, Europe, and Asia; America contributing to Europe its horses and camels, while Europe and Asia contributed to North America virtually all of the large existing fauna at the present time. But for this great contribution, North America would today be virtually barren, because the only quadruped of any considerable size, indigenous to North America, which survived the Glacial period is the pronghorn antelope.","Europe sent us elephants and mammoths, which have become extinct, as well as all the great quadrupeds which still survive, as our moose, caribou, wapiti or true deer, Virginia deer, and, also, among Carnivora, the bear and the wolf. The primitive, or Paleolithic, man of Europe was a hunter. The earliest objects of human manufacture known are not utensils for the preparation of food, but weapons, of flint and stone, for the killing of game; the earliest works of art are representations of game animals, some of them of considerable artistic merit. There is no a priori reason why these Paleolithic hunters should not have followed the game in its exodus from Europe and Asia into North America; there is, on the contrary, much reason to believe that the older parts of Europe were already thickly populated, that there was considerable competition between different races of men in the chase. That hunting was carried on on a vast scale is proved by the enormous numbers of bones which were piled about some of the ancient hunting camps."

These skeletons are known as the men of Spy. They enable us to reconstruct the entire head and the framework of the limbs of the men of Spy.

During this time some races of men probably continued for long periods with little physical change. I am sorry the short time does not permit me to discuss more than one of the several occurrences that many feel establish the presence of early man in America. One of the cultural phases I am exhibiting here to-night —artifacts that were found associated with the remains of an extinct species of bison found in New Mexico, during the past two years by an expedition from the Colorado Museum of Natural History. Many artifacts similar in form are to be found in various museum collections in the United States, but they have not before been recognized as representing a cultural phase.","Now that we can associate them definitely with an extinct animal, of considerable antiquity, and the surrounding conditions preclude their having been made by historic men, they are definitely recognized as a cultural phase.

A distinctive feature is the form of the blade, hollowed on the sides with the widest part anterior to the middle. Unlike the triangular form of modern arrowpoints, which wedge from the moment they enter a skin until they penetrate beyond the barbs, this type of point makes the greatest incision at the initial impact, thus, with the same impetus, penetrating farther into a resisting body than the triangular point. These artifacts are probably darts, antedating the bow and arrow, and if they are recognized as distinctive, may be designated as the ""Folsoin culture."""

Much of the country is covered with lava 30 to 130 feet in depth overlying Niobrara shales. In places the lava plateau has been eroded. At this particular point the lava has been eroded forming a horseshoe-shaped basin covering an area of approximately five square miles. The walls of the basin are vertical and we think the flow was of Pliocene age.","There are numerous extinct craters in this vicinity. Subsequent to the erosion of this basin, one of the craters again became active throwing a secondary flow across the two prongs of the horseshoe, thus closing it at the lower end. This flow is 40 feet in depth. Undoubtedly it dammed up the natural drainage and a lake was probably formed in the lower part of the basin. If I have interpreted the occurrence correctly a group of prehistoric bison were surrounded on the upper border of this lake by a number of prehistoric men and several bison were killed—probably a meat-kill."

It is pretty clear that at various times during the last 40,000 years, natural land and ice bridges connected Siberia and Alaska. Migrating animals freely crossed back and forth and several large groups or tribes of hunters followed herds across into the New World, the first more than 12,000 years ago. We know very little of these first Americans except how they procured food — in fact virtually all of our knowledge comes from hunting skills. These earliest Indians are called Clovis and Folsom people, after the p.aces in New Mexico where their artifacts were first found.","The oldest remains indicate that these hunters stalked very large animals — giant mammoths, bison, sloths, and camels — all of which were becoming scarce at that time and extinct by about 7,000 years ago. Undoubtedly they hunted everything and also made some use of plants in season as well. Generally they seem to have killed one animal at a time, and often the evidence indicates that it was sick, aged, young, injured, or trapped in mud or in a sink hole. Occasionally great herds were wiped out by stampeding them off cliffs into ravines or through mucky swamps. These methods were extremely wasteful since far more animals were killed than could be used, but the vast bone beds meticulously excavated by today's trained archeologists are spectacular to see."

Antevs' studies of the last ice sheet led to the suggestion that corridors may have opened between the eastern and western ice centers, allowing man to come down through the great lowlands east of the Rockies.7 Such a corridor may have existed during the mid-Wisconsin-stage mild period, between 40,000 and 25,000 years ago.

Similarly, introduction of European animals and plants reshaped the Americas.","Wheat, apples, and grapes have certainly flourished here; pigs and horses, which had become extinct in the hemisphere after the last Ice Age, were reintroduced by the Europeans and changed the culture of the Plains Indians and other tribes for good. We now find it hard even to imagine the Plains Indians without the horses that they integrated so majestically into their traditional culture. Sugarcane brought to the Caribbean also increased the need for Africans to work the fields there because they were resistant to European and African diseases, as the natives of the Caribbean were not. So sweeteners and slavery fed one another. This information, and much more of sound historical value to all America's ethnic groups, is registered in the exhibit."

Joseph Howe, newly-appointed Indian commissioner for Nova Scotia in 1843, called attention to the French and German settlers in that colony. These, he observed, though living among the British for a hundred years, still were essentially French and German. It was not surprising, he asserted, that the Indians would take time to change. Although reserves had been created and Indian policy had begun to emerge by this time, Howe found the reserves inadequate, isolated (no roads), and encroached upon by whites, as well as some counties which had no reserves.","Population decline would, he believed, make the Indians extinct in forty or fifty years if the rate remained unchanged.

Powell published his definitive study of American Indian linguistic families in 1891, he credited Gallatin as the person who previously had contributed the most to the subject. The essence of Powell's classification has withstood the test of time, but he deserves credit primarily for assembling sources rather than for making a highly original contribution. A map was prepared and fifty-eight language families were recognized; it was revised slightly in 1907 and has been reproduced on innumerable occasions. The classification which prevails at present is based on the studies by Gallatin and Powell. Compiled by C. F. and F. M. Voegelin, it was released in 1966 and appears in simplified form as Map 1.","In conclusion, it should be noted that of the approximately 300 aboriginal languages spoken during the early historical period, about half of them now are extinct. Wallace L. Chafe estimates that about half of the surviving languages are not spoken by children of the tribes involved, and it seems unlikely that these languages will endure beyond the present century. The languages which seem likely to last the longest are Cree, Chippewa, Eskimo, and Navajo; Chafe doubts, however, that they will be spoken 150 years from now. Culture Areas Linguists were the first to establish the relationships among tribes on a sound conceptual basis. They identified families of related languages, whose speakers unquestionably were derived from a common background."

A number of duck species, including the mallard (Anas platrhynchos), black duck (A. rubripes), common teal (A. crecca), and American wigeon (A. americana), commonly winter along the Carolina coast, and a small number may live year-round on the coast (Potter et al. 1980:89-90).","A few skeletal elements of the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), now extinct, are found at 38CH124.

The Carolina diamondback terrapin inhabits the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina to Florida (Obst 1986:214). The diamondback terrapin was an important food resource in the southeast (Hilliard 1972:89) that became an accepted delicacy throughout the United States during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Obst 1986:113, 183).

Only two sites, Bonfire Shelter near Langtry and the Devil's Mouth Site on a terrace at the juncture of the Devils River with the Rio Grande, have yielded Paleo-Indian artifacts. Bonfire Shelter was a bison-kill site, so situated that PLATE 9 No. 1. These paintings are all that remain of what were once a large number of pictographs in Eagle Cave, Mile Canyon, near Langtry."

A radiocarbon date obtained from charcoal in its extensive bone deposits yielded a date of 10,230 160 years before the present. The attractiveness of this site as a bison ""jump"" is demonstrated by the fact that an Archaic people thousands of years later used it in the same way to secure modern bison (Dibble, 1965). No evidence has ever been found that the widespread Paleo-Indian hunters, either in the lower Pecos region or elsewhere, practiced pictography.

But there is no indication that these or any later occupants painted or otherwise ornamented its rock walls (Suhm et al., 1954:101-102; Suhm, 1958:72–73). The Levi Shelter in the Pedernales River drainage system west of Austin (Blanco County, see Map 5) also served as a dwelling place of Paleo-Indian hunters as well as later peoples, but its rock surfaces are also barren of paintings and drawings (Alexander, 1963). Paleo-Indians left other scattered indications of their presence in Central Texas, but there is no evidence of any sort that they practiced the petrographic arts. By about 5000 B.C. the Paleo-Indian cultures of Central Texas had disappeared and had been replaced by Archaic cultures.","The mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, and other large game animals upon which these hunters depended had become extinct. If men were to continue to thrive in Central Texas, new sources of food, new adjustments to nature had to be made. In Central Texas the solution of the Archaic peoples was to broaden the range of items used for food. Hunting remained an important activity and perhaps game animals supplied the bulk of the food supply, but considerable usage was now made of wild plant foods – roots, seeds, fruits, tubers, and the like.

The late Paleoindian period (11,000-8,000 B.P.) is represented by a mobile culture, which maintains a high dependence on modern large fauna as the primary component of the diet. However, traditional big game was becoming scarce and the diet was beginning to change, encouraging a transition to more reliable flora and smaller fauna species. Temporally diagnostic artifacts of the period are the Great Basin Stemmed Point and crescent-shaped bifaces (Thompson and Thompson 1982). The late Paleoindian period of the eastern Great Basin has been termed the Western Pluvial Lakes Tradition (WPLT) -an unfortunate misnomer, because not all WPLT sites are associated with pluvial lakes.","Clovis-style projectile points are often found in association with extinct mammoth remains. The large Clovis point is commonly fluted and triangular in shape, and contains a basal notch. During the end of the Llano period, North America was in transition as the retreating ice sheets were giving way to a more temperate climate. The warmer climate in which humans found themselves also brought with it a new type of large prey -the bison (Bison bison antiquus). The Folsom point utilized by the bison hunters was smaller than the Clovis, and characterized by large medial flutes."

The only direct evidence related to aboriginal hunting technique from the various Mound D excavations consists of three deer specimens, vertebrae and a pelvis with fragments of projectile points embedded in them (Figure 85). In two of these specimens, apparent resorption around the wound indicated the animal survived its attack. This is also an indication that deer were hunted by stalking-although other methods such as enclosures may also have been used (Ruhl 1956:251; Swanton 1946:312). The predominance of passenger pigeons in the Mound D sample gives indirect evidence of the use of hunting techniques other than projectiles.","Passenger pigeons have been extinct since the early part of the twentieth century.

This was considered a positive sign of growth within the discipline, reflecting the interest of more scholars in bioarcheology of Texas populations and a potential for more detailed analyses of material recovered. These last three decades have also seen an increase in the depth of analysis. While the earlier works of Lux (1935, 1936, and 1938), Goldstein (1940a, 1940b, 1941, 1948, 1953, 1957) and Newman (1953) are laudable, the later research of Wilkinson (1973), Aten (1965a, 1976a, 1976b, 1976c), Malina and Bramblett (1981), Young et al.

When we examine the research reported during the first three decades of bioarcheology in the area it is apparent that the reports are simple documentation of the presence of human skeletal remains associated with archeological sites (e.g., Simmons 1903; Dietz 1935; Meroney 1936; Shuler 1923; and Watt and Meroney 1938a).","Of these reports, Shuler's report published in Science has drawn the most notice since it reported the recovery from near Dallas of mineralized human bone found in association with extinct Pleistocene fauna. More recently, Oakley and Howells (1961) have documented that the material was indeed mineralized, but that the levels of fluorine, uranium, and nitrogen in the human bone clearly indicates that they are of more recent origin than the Pleistocene fauna from the same deposits. The one notable exception to this simple documentation of the presence of human bone are the bioarcheological contributions concerning the mass burial near Waco.

It may represent a local variant of an extreme order or it may be simply a morphologically degenerate type (Carter 1942:24). The final consensus concerning the primitive affinities of these several specimens emphasized that the remains were morphologically modern and not representative of Archaic Homo sapiens or “Neaderthaloids” and that the antiquity of American skeletal remains must be established on a geological basis rather than by their morphological structure. Given this stance, later studies of fossilized remains placed emphasis on stratigraphic context in conjunction with the application of chemical (i.e. fluorine, radiocarbon) and physical tests of the bones and associated materials. A partial skull found at the Scharbauer site 8 km south of Midland, Texas was extensively studied to gain evidence of its antiquity (Wendorf and Krieger 1959; Wendorf, Krieger, Albritton and Stewart 1955).","The calvarium and a few fragments of the postcranial skeleton were exposed by wind erosion in sand deposits that also included the bones of extinct Pleistocene fauna. Test excavations were conducted to establish site stratigraphy and the association of the human remains within the strata: When the human skull was first discovered by Keith Glasscock it was being exposed by wind erosion. There were no indications of a burial pit or other disturbance. On the other hand, particles of gray sand adhered to the skull and were covered by a calcium deposit; and the skull appeared to be fully as fossilized as the Pleistocene faunal remains from the white and gray sands. The real proof, however, of the skull's primary association with the gray sand rested upon an exhaustive series of chemical analyses which showed conclusivelya, that these fossils differed greatly in their chemical content from modern animal bones; b, that fossils from within the white, gray, and red sands all were similar in their chemical content and therefore essentially contemporaneous; and c, that the human fossil was unquestionably contemporaneous with the Pleistocene fauna from this site (Wendorf and Krieger 1959:67)."

In South America there are many nations, many approaches to archaeology, and few tendencies toward terminological consistency. Few archaeologists have been obsessed by analytic consistency or neatly defined concepts, such as would provide a simple, continent-wide separation of Paleoindians from other, more broadly adapted peoples. Also, although the savannas, thorn forests, pampas, punas, and paramos were good habitats in which to hunt the Pleistocene megafauna, generally they were smaller, disjunctive, and less well stocked than their North American equivalents. There were neither mammoths nor bison, although the fauna included camelids (Palaeolama, Protauchenia), mastodons, three genera of horses, large megatherid and mylodont sloths, as well as glyptodons, toxodons, and the giant capybara.","All are extinct, and all but the giant capybara have been claimed, by one archaeologist or another, to be in association with human predators. It has been argued that, even allowing for excessive taxonomic splitting, South America lost more major mammals during the late Pleistocene than any other continent. Although brief, the Paleoindian exploitation may have been intensive and thoroughly destructive of the Pleistocene fauna. On the other hand, many extant animals and plants, presumably used as food, have been recorded from late Paleoindian or early Archaic sites, especially in the Andes. If their ancestors had recently passed through lower central America, perhaps adapting to some forest resources and less open environments, it should not surprise us that the South American Paleoindians no longer fit the classical North American big-game hunting definition."

We are accustomed to drawing a line between two basic explanations for human diversity around the globe: one created by God's hand (creationism) and the other a result of gradual change independent of God's continued involvement with the world (evolutionism). But in the nineteenth century more views abounded, which can be labeled as polygenesis, monogenetic degeneration, and monogenetic evolution. POLYGENESIS As the term implies, polygenesis (also known as pluralism and strongly underlain by hereditarianism, or the idea that biology creates destiny) was the unorthodox view that different human “types” represented not only different “races” but different species of humanity, each a result of separate acts of creation by God.","This viewpoint was supported by attempts to explain the unfamiliar, extinct fossil remains in geological layers by positing something called catastrophism, or the idea that the world was destroyed and re-created several times by God's hand. This viewpoint was developed aggressively in France but was always less accepted than theories based on the conventional explanations of difference as a result of something that happened after God's initial, singular acts of creation, or monogenesis. MONOGENETIC DEGENERATION Degenerationists believed in monogenesis but said that human differences are a result of the degeneration of some people away from God's original grace. This process began in the Garden of Eden when the possibility of true human oneness was destroyed by Adam and Eve's disobedience, and humans were cast out to fend for themselves. Those who stayed close to God's word, believing that he would bring a savior one day to redeem them from their original sin, retained most of the original features of God's creation, including white skin."

Anthropologists like Broca and Royer, who accepted human evolution, were skeptical that Europeans came from Asia, because their thinking was not circumscribed by the Bible and because they recognized fossils as evidence of indigenous development. Contrarily, anthropologists like Pruner-Bey, who clung to the orthodox Indo-European view, were skeptical about evolution. Certainly Aryanism delayed anthropologists' acceptance of evolution. They regarded fossils more as pre-Aryans than as missing links.","In fossil man inventories of the period, Ergis, Neanderthal, Cro-Magnon and other specimens were called extinct races rather than extinct species, so there was no threat of species mutability-the essence of evolution. Armand de Quatrefages and E. T. Hamy wrote the most authoritative work, Crania ethnica (last volume 1882), and it was designed to dispute Retzius rather than discuss Darwin. Few anthropologists made true evolutionary studies of fossil man until after A.D. 1900 (Erickson 1974:140-230). Aryanism was a theory of racial succession by replacement rather than transformation. Even those anthropologists who believed that Neanderthal man evolved into Cro-Magnon man were reluctant to believe that CroMagnon and Neanderthal were classed as prehistoric barbarians, while the Neolithic and historic peoples were associated with the Indo-European incursion."

And it may well be that between the early 1800s and the reservation period, giveaways were elaborate distributions of a chief's fine array of horses. But my sense is that these were of rare vintage. Rather that the common type of giveaway was that held by the average traditional Lakota who wanted to commemorate the death of his family members through proper observance of native ritual. In the 20th century, the number of observers of indigenous ritual has declined to the extent that only three native rituals are still held with any regularity and seeming permanence: these are the Sweatlodge Ceremony, the Vision Ouest and the Sun Dance, all highly visible and dramatic events.","Other ceremonies such as the Girl's Puberty Rite or Throwing of the Ball are nearly extinct. But the Keeping of the Soul ceremony continues to be observed by some, in its traditional form, by others, in its modified, more modern counterpart, the giveaway. More than any other ceremony, the giveaway links most Lakota — not the rare Sun Dancer, but the generally more low-profile Lakota—to the ceremonies which for several hundred years have defined them as a cultural entity. In this way it has become increasingly a significant marker of Indian identity by separating those who observe native tradition from those who do not. Since, with the possible exception of yuwipi and lowanpi curing rituals, many elements of the truly indigenous practices are gone, observance of the giveaway is a contemporary declaration of a Lakota-style observation of the rites of passages, in this case, death."

Analysis of settlement patterns may provide valuable insights into the social and economic behavior of past human populations, insights that would elude the archeologist who adopted a more fragmentary view of the site data base. An underlying assumption of all settlement pattern analyses is that proximity on a spatial dimension is an indication of proximity on social, economic, and other dimensions as well. For example, if archeological sites are clustered with respect to certain nonrandomly distributed environmental variables, the archeologist may reasonably infer that the environmental variables in question may have influenced site location decisions.

This is only a slight wear pattern, but after observing it on experimental shell hoes it was later observed on the prehistoric models. Conclusion Experimental duplication of tools and study of wear patterns on prehistoric artifacts in bone, stone, clay or shell, betters our understanding of obscure preindustrial technologies. The use of shells for hoe blades attests to the ingenuous use of items occurring in the local natural environment by prehistoric horticulturalists in the Ohio Valley prior to the introduction of European trade items that so drastically usurped the indigenous cultural adaptations. Original research supports the traditional classification of large perforated bivalves from Fort Ancient sites as shell hoes.","Making and using Indian artifacts gives modern people a more realistic insight into extinct lifestyles based on stone age technologies.

I don’t think I could have done that myself; the temptation to take the thing out and look at it would have been so strong! I expected to find the Hunter charcoal beds pretty well dug over, and I was not disappointed; but before I had time to feel badly about it, my old friend and helper, Fay Perkins, discovered another series of them about half a mile up the Vegas Wash.

Surrounding tribes resented the arrival of the Pequots almost as much as they resented the presence of European settlers. When the Pequots killed several unscrupulous English traders in 1636, the Puritan magistrates retaliated in vengeance. Employing the Narraganset tribe as an ally, the Puritan army surrounded the main village of the Pequots on the Mystic River, set it afire, then brutally slaughtered the more than four hundred unprotected inhabitants (most of their braves were in a war party elsewhere) as they attempted to escape the flames. The Puritans then pursued survivors mercilessly, hunting them down and either killing them or selling them into slavery.","The Pequots as a people were essentially extinct in 1638, what few survivors there were having joined the Mohegans. In describing the attack on the Pequot village at Mystic, Governor William Bradford of the Plymouth colony illustrated the fervent union of religious zeal, racism, and cosmic certainty so characteristic of the Puritan mind: Those that escaped the fire were slain with the sword, some hewed to pieces, others run through with their rapiers, so as they were quickly dispatched and very few escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time. It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fire and the streams of blood quenching the same, and horrible was the stink and scent thereof; but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they (the Puritans] gave the praise thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands and give them so speedy a victory. * In the years immediately following the Pequot War, the Puritans also tried to deal with their “Indian problem” through creation of a reservation system."

R. HARRINGTON | HAT the horse originated in America and spread from here to the Old World is claimed by those who have studied his fossil remains; on the other hand it seems to be a fact that there were no horses at all in the Western Hemisphere when America was discovered by the whites; the Indians had never heard of such a creature, and were obliged to devise names for him. The so-called “Horse Indians” of the plains were pedestrians until the Spaniards—in some cases involuntarily—supplied them with mounts. All of which leads to the question, Why and when did the { American horse disappear from the land of his ancestors? I should really say “horses” instead of “horse,” for there were a number of different kinds in ancient America during the Pleistocene or Ice Age, the last geological period that preceded our own, although none of them was startlingly unlike our present breeds.","This question is of special interest to archeologists, and consequently to the Southwest Museum, because of late, on several occasions, bones of extinct American horses have been"

There is another way to look at the Eskimo in Canadian literature, however, and that is to look at him from his own perspective, to see how he sees himself, and to consider that literature which he has produced. In 1962, Keiichi Hirano examined the aborigine in Canadian literature and regretfully came to the conclusion that native literature was only a peripheral part of the contemporary literary scene.1 Ten years later, Margaret Atwood noted in her chapter ""Early People"", in Survival, that until recently, Indians and Eskimos made their appearance in Canadian literature only in books written by white writers. 2"

To this point I feel that I have been handling facts only, and deducing from them only logical inferences; but now looms up the natural and ever-interesting question, Who were these people? The origin of any race is a difficult problem to solve, but none can compare with these misty vestiges of prehistoric humanity. It seems to me but one inference is permissible: they who fashioned these rude argillite implements were the descendants of palaeolithic man, and his superior in so far as a knowledge of the bow and arrow and rude pottery indicates.

By referring these intermediate people to the existing Eskimos, I would not be understood as maintaining that these boreal people were directly descended from the argillite-using folk of the Delaware Valley, but that both were derived from palaeolithic man; in other words, that with the disappearance of glacial conditions in the Delaware valley, and the retirement northward of the continental ice-sheet, if such there were, the people of that distant day followed in its tracks, and lived the same life their ancestors had lived when northern New Jersey was as bleak as is Greenland today; but that not all of this strange people wero so enamored of"

If these forms are really of Tertiary origin, we have here one of the greatest marvels yet encountered by science; and perhaps if Professor Whitney had fully appreciated the story of human evolution as it is understood today, he would have hesitated to announce the conclusions formulated, notwithstanding the imposing array of testimony with which he was confronted.

This was a time of increasingly arid climate on the North American continent, as the luxuriant carpet of grasses grew sparse. Mammoths, horses, and camels were dying out or were already gone, and even the big-horned bison had begun giving way to the species that survives today. The prey animal in which the largest number of Plano points have been found is still the big-horned bison, but at some sites the remains of modern bison, pronghorn antelope, and even deer also occur.","THE GREAT EXTINCTION The bones of ice-age mammals, and the variety of weapons and tools used to kill and butcher them, have left an impressive record, all the way from Alaska to Cape Horn, of the Paleo-Indians' ability to exploit their environment. It was the climate—the very thing that had brought it into existence in the first place—that caused the hunting economy to dwindle and finally, about 7,000 years ago, to disappear. At the end of the last ice age the climate in interior North America was generally cool and moist, with numerous shallow lakes bordered by luxuriant vegetation. Under these conditions, ideal for hunting, lived the people who made the Llano and Folsom points, and the same conditions prevailed for most of the Plano people also."

With the northward retreat of the cold air masses, precipitation probably was reduced as well. Slowly at first, and then at an accelerating rate, the plant cover thinned out, and the great herds declined drastically. The end of the limitless abundance is marked by the last of the Paleo-Indian sites based on big-game hunting, dating to some 7,000 years ago. From then on, the hunting of large mammals was limited largely to a few wet areas in the plains, where it was based solely on the modern species of bison, and of course in the Sub-Arctic, where moose and caribou are still hunted today.","The last ice age closed dramatically with the melting of huge blocks of ice, pouring out freshets of water that swelled into torrents—and it closed also with one of the greatest extinctions of mammals the planet has ever known.

Prewitt discusses the earlier writings of Harrington, Speck, and Michelson, augmented by the observations of present-day anthropologists flavored with his own analytical observations.","The paper does not add substantially to what has already been written about the now extinct ceremony. Prewitt himself is competent to write a definitive monograph on the Big House to compensate for a work he wrote whose quality was unfortunately perverted by atrocious editing (Prewitt 1981). Prewitt inclines to denigrate Speck, stating his account of the Big House was ""produced from the account of an individual who was never an official functionary"" (p. 50). Speck's chief informant Witapanoxwe was a native speaker of the Turkey group, elected to the Turkey Council in 1902; as a member of the Council he carved one of the faces on the side posts; he was a visionary, he had recited a vision on the 12th night of the ceremony; he had a clear recollection of Chief Charles Elkair's manner of conducting the ceremony, having frequently participated in it under the chief's direction; and his narration of the ceremony is the only one extant in the native tongue (Speck 1931).

DISCUSSION Charles C. Willoughby's Prehistoric Burial Places, 1898, details burial excavations at Ellsworth, NkLne. Artifacts retrieved from local collectors included ""sixteen finely polished and gracefully shaped lanceheads, typical forms of which are shown in Figure 16"" (1898: 401, 402). They are of compact green slate, with cross section either lenticular, lozenge-shaped or hexagonal.""

He stated that these grave goods antedate Algonqian presence in the Northeast, ""the burials in these old cemeteries cannot be attributed to that people"" (1898: 434). Warren K. Nborehead's rambles in Maine unearthed several sites containing lithic material and forms comparable to those discussed in this paper. Ramah chert appeared in more than one site (1922: 112, Figure 48, p. 105), and slate bayonets or lanceheads either singly or in clusters, were excavated at Hathaway cemetery (1922, Figure 31), Emerson Cemetery on Lake Alamoosook (1922: 34, Figure 24), Haskell's Cemetery, Blue Hill (1922: 67, Figure 40). He credits these burials with great antiquity, and attributes them to a people ""separate and distinct from other tribes of the New england region."

A minimum of 7 bobwhites and only one prairie chicken was recorded in this rockshelter faunal sample and, like the waterfowl, these few birds contributed little to the food economy of the inhabitants. The ruffed grouse was numerous in most wooded parts of Missouri and may well have occurred in association with the turkey in the timbered areas near Tick Creek Cave, but only one wing element (carpometacarpus) was found in the midden deposit. Although the bird was formerly abundant in Missouri, occupants of Tick Creek Cave made little use of the passenger pigeon.","Over 100 skeletal elements, representing at least 12 birds, were found of this now extinct species, but the amount of meat derived from these few birds was negligible. Of interest was the recovery of three raven bones, two apparently from nestling or very young birds.

Widmann (1907) mentions a small colony of ravens that nested a few years before (1901) near Vienna on the Gasconade. There was no evidence to indicate that the raven had been used by these Indians, but the use of this particular bird as a symbol and for ornaments and decoration was not an uncommon practice (Wittry, 1962; Bray, 1961)."

Four years (1941–1944), including one very wet one (1941) were required for the recovery of the land to its original grass cover (Weaver 1968).

This climatic amelioration appears closely linked to a world-wide warming trend that began some 14,500 years ago (Mercer 1972; H. E. Wright 1972). By 10,000 years ago, the glacial retreat was well underway and significant changes were occurring in plant and animal distributions (Bernabo and Webb 1977:72–73; J. E. King 1980; Webb and Bryson 1972). For example, deciduous forest replaced spruce by 11,300 years ago in northeastern Kansas and, by 10,000 years ago, grasslands were prevalent there (Gruger 1973:248, Figure 3). In contrast, spruce dominated Minnesota settings until some 11,000 years ago when pine began invading from the east; then around 7000 years ago, grasslands expanded into some of Minnesota's pine forests (H.

Numbering approximately 1300 persons, the Esselen moved as small, seminomadic bands among favored camps to exploit both littoral and interior zones.

He was called from his house by a Sonorian [sic] whose name we did not learn, and who without any provocation whatever, plunged a knife in to his heart, killing him instantly.

Trade and expansion accelerated, thus changing tribal social configuration. Today, divergent views on societal structuring exist, a woodlands origin is one hypothesis (Wissler, 1957). Also, the adoption of bison hunting by mounted Ute, Shoshone, and Nez Perce, is considered responsible for replacement of the nucleated family structure by a band level organization. Movement to the plains to hunt bison was gradual and only small herds were available in Utah prior to 1830.","Bison in western Colorado and Utah were extinct by 1870. This forced the Utes to move into Wyoming and eastern Colorado to hunt. Dependence upon small game hunting, traditional among basin-plateau cultures between 1800-1870, was dropped by the Ute and Northern Shoshone. They began hunting bison and other large game on horseback; the Uintah Ute were the exception since few horses were available. As the tradition changed, the social emphasis shifted from a family based territorial subsistence economy to that of a semi-nomadic lifestyle informally led by a charismatic leader."

The broad problem of culture contact will be a continuing concern for future studies, to the extent that human behaviors are reflected in the archaeological record. Comparisons are needed to define the life of the Indians under the mission system and their experience on the ranchos and in the pueblos. Questions about which aspects of the imposed culture were additions, as opposed to replacements, need to be investigated at contact sites and historical rancherías. The same kinds of questions apply to the early Mexican pobladores and later waves of immigrants, and to the ranchero families of declining fortunes.","Not as individuals, of course, but as a culture, the Californio became extinct within a generation of the Gold Rush (Pitt 1971; Wollenberg 1970:55).

With the completion of this phase of survey, a total of 262 archaeological samples had been recovered from 425 sampling units (see Appendixes 4 and 5). Sampling Methodology Probabilistic archaeological survey within the study area employed a ""non-site"" sampling design. This necessitated abandoning the concept of site for the immediate purpose of archaeological resource identification and relying instead upon the systematic sampling and inspection of units of geographical space, defined by an imaginary grid imposed on the study area. The applicability of this general method of regional sampling for addressing questions about aboriginal land use has been amply demonstrated by Thomas (1971, 1975).","Recently, Dunnell and Dancey (1983) have argued that use of the site concept within regional archaeological survey can actually inhibit a clear and concise understanding of the extinct behavioral systems being studied. Two primary reasons can be offered for employing a ""non-site"" sampling design for regional land-use studies. First, most archaeological surveys are undertaken to gain some understanding of the kinds and frequency of archaeological manifestations present within a study area. Such surveys generally aspire to provide a sample in which all relevant archaeological resources expected to occur within a given area have an opportunity to be observed. If generalization is a principal goal of an archaeological survey, then it would appear useful that some form of random sampling be employed to help insure that the resultant data represent an unbiased estimate of the phenomena they represent."

The purpose in presenting this collection of papers is to begin to fill a major void in what we know about those portions of the Great Basin where wetlands are present. As C. Fowler (1977, 1982) has reminded us several times, we do not know very much about these areas, either ethnographically or prehistorically. Part of the problem is that the ecology of the regions containing the most extensive wetlands have been dramatically altered. Ofttimes those were the places where European settlement first occurred.","Consequently, not only are we confronted with reconstructing extinct lifeways (a difficult task by itself), we are faced with the even more onerous problem of understanding very complex ecosystems. We hope that this collection of papers can make an important step in rectifying that problem, without adding to the contrastive literature of Great Basin anthropology. These papers address a wide range of problems from understanding regional material culture (for example, Pinto, Tuohy) to presenting broad overviews (for example, Fowler and Fowler, Oetting, Greenspan) to rather specific analyses of archaeologically recovered data (for example, Brooks et al, Drews) to addressing regional problems of subsistence (Schmitt and Sharp, Dansie) and settlement (Cannon et al., Raymond and Parks, Rhode) or both (Janetski, Kelly). As usual, the western Great Basin wetland systems are the best represented here but papers from the east (Janetski) and northwest (Greenspan, Oetting, Cannon et al.) give the volume a Basin-wide perspective. Only one (C. Fowler) is ethnographic; however, the appearance of this volume seems well timed as two additional ethnographic works for Pyramid and Walker lakes in the west (C.

They were probably first recorded by one or more of the native names listed by Escandón in 1747. Perhaps the most important clue to the identity of these Mulatos is provided by linguistic evidence.

In 1757 López de la Cámara Alta (1946, 116) noticed tattooing among the various Rio Grande delta Indians that he encountered, and he said that men were tattooed on the face; women, on both face and body. He also said he could not tell one group from another on the basis of tattoo patterns, which probably means that tattooing was not primarily for purposes of ethnic identification. López de la Cámara Alta (1946, 119) also gave essentially the same information for several groups later seen farther up the Rio Grande, among them Cacalotes, Carrizos (eastern), and Cotonames. He noted, however, that these groups added to their tattooing every year.","Gatschet's Comecrudo vocabulary of 1886 refers to the Rio Grande Pintos, then extinct, as having been tattooed. In 1738 Ladrón de Guevara (1738, 65) commented on tattooing among the Tanaquiapemes of the lower Río San Fernando, noting that the lines of tattooing were narrow like the mark left by a lash (verdugón). Among other Indians of that coastal region, he said, the tattoo lines were somewhat broader. This seems to indicate significant stylistic differences, but not much else can be deduced from his remarks."

Crawford, James Madison's secretary of war.","“They must become civilized, or they will finally ... become extinct.” The Gradualists foresaw no unsolvable problems with those Indians unwilling to alter or abandon either nonagricultural subsistence patterns or their accustomed life-style. They suggested to critics that the steady movement of the American agricultural frontier toward the Mississippi would deplete the wild game that these Indians depended upon for survival. When they could not find sufficient food, they would be compelled to move out of the settlers' way. The Gradualists confidently expected their program to achieve two critical objectives: It would civilize and assimilate a sizeable number of Indians, while facilitating peaceful relations between them and white settlers on the frontier as the westward movement proceeded."

They, too, sought peaceful relations between Americans and Indians, but they were never sufficiently persuaded that the plan advanced by the Gradualists held much likelihood of success.","“There seems to be a deep rooted superstition ... that the Indians are really destined, as if there were some fatality in the case, never to be christionized, but gradually to decay till they become totally extinct,” one missionary surmised. The Removalists contended that most Indians were little interested in being “civilized.” Perhaps the actual problem, they speculated, really was not one of disinclination, but of incapacity. Most Americans, concluded George W. Manypenny, who held the post of commissioner of Indian Affairs from 1853– 1857, regarded Indians as “irreclaimable, terrible” savages.

This resulted from market hunting for meat and hides, the shooting of pronghorns to prevent their grazing on rangelands or agricultural crops, and range changes resulting from introduction of domestic sheep and cattle and non-native plants. These factors also caused the extirpation of tule elk from much of their original range in California (Mc Cullough 1969).

Fortunately the study of these remains and their association was early intrusted to one who commands the confidence of every American scholar in these lines, namely, Prof. John C. Merriam, of the University of California. On August 7, 1914, in Science, appeared his report, which shows the circumstances and scientific value of the find in their true perspective."" The report is so concise and to the point that it is necessary to quote it almost bodily. It reads: In January, 1914, the Museum of History, Science, and Art, of Los Angeles, being inconvenienced by heavy rains filling the pits already in process of excavation in the asphalt deposits at Rancho La Brea, began work at a new locality, which was designated as pit No. 10.","Work was started at a point a short distance southwest of a large pit from which many remains of extinct animals had been obtained in previous years. The point at which excavation was initiated was marked by a seepage from which tar had poured out in comparatively recent time. The excavation of this locality showed the presence of two vents or chimneys filled with asphalt. The chimneys were each about 3 feet in diameter and both had contributed to a hard asphaltic layer, forming the surface of the ground at this point. At a depth of about 8 feet the chimneys opened into a large dome-shaped asphaltic mass not less than 8 feet in diameter and extending downward to an unknown depth."

As to Dr. Sellards's report, it is partly a reprint of that in the American Anthropologist (April– June, 1917) and for the rest is paleontological.

The age of the deposits containing these fossils, according to the accepted interpretation of faunas and floras, is Pleistocene.” As the interest in the Vero deposits continues there is a strong hope that a human burial in much better condition than those thus far found may be discovered.

The adaptive model presented in the text is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather is based on what is generally known or predictable. A brief description is provided of the natural setting, cultural history and paleoenvironment in order to examine the geographic and natural context in an effort to define the plant, animal and mineral resource potential for the region. The question of how the various resources were used is partly answered by the excellent preservation of organic materials in the numerous dry rockshelters in the limestone canyons. Careful excavations and extensive and intensive analyses of these materials in recent years have yielded an excellent body of information on the economic patterns of the Archaic populations.","The prehistory of the lower Pecos region can be traced back to the terminal stages of the last major glacial period, perhaps to about 14,000 years ago when populations of now extinct Pleistocene fauna still inhabited the area. There is some indication that these big game animals were the prey of the first human groups to appear in the region based on findings at sites such as Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorraine 1968) and possibly at 41 VV 162A (Johnson 1978). It is doubtful that such populations could be considered as resident inhabitants since their existence is represented by a mere trace of evidence and not all of that is convincing. More likely, if human groups were here at that early time, they were migrant bands whose movements were probably dictated in part by the migratory patterns of the large game animals which were among those being hunted. About 9,500 years ago, small bands of foraging groups began to settle in the deeply entrenched canyon system of the lower Pecos, Devil's and Rio Grande Rivers (Fig. 1)."

Although it is often assumed that they were, it was not until 1979 that any evidence was found for such an association (Graham 1979). A single site is hardly sufficient evidence to confirm this long cherished notion; Kimmswick could be the provocative exception rather than the rule. Beyond the question of the association of Paleo-Indian with mastodon is the question of whether mastodon were really part of the fauna available to the makers of the Henry County and other Paleo-Indian points. In considering this question, the identification of the Henry County specimen and the dating of Paleo-Indian complexes becomes important.","Clovis hunters in southwest Missouri may well have at least encountered mastodon in their environment; however, they also would have witnessed if not the mastodon's extinction, at least the waning of the spruce forest on which it depended. Pollen records, faunal assemblages, and radiocarbon dates from Boney Spring on the Pomme de Terre River (Fig. 1) suggest that spruce forest, with an associated megafauna of mastodon, tapir, ground sloth, deer, giant beaver, and horse were still present around 13,550 B.P.

The most important conclusion was that the earth was changing very slowly in physical terms and that therefore it must be very old.,"Before long a French civil servant, Boucher de Perthes, established as a result of archaeological studies that men once lived among animals now extinct. Boucher's conclusions were a direct challenge to the idea that God in his wisdom had created a perfect world and that all the creatures which existed originally still lived. In the 1840's the thoughts of Charles Darwin were crystallizing and soon would produce the evolution revolution. Not until the knowledge gained, by investigators in the first half of the nineteenth century had been sorted, ordered, and broadly accepted could a synthesis of American Indian prehistory be advanced in reasonable terms.

Although his primary interest was not in aboriginal Americans, he was the first to suggest a sequential patterning for Indian cultural development. In Pre-Historic Times (1865) he suggested that the first people were barbarians, which presumably meant Indians who lived mainly by hunting. The next stage was that of the mound builders, and it was followed by farmers; by the time of historic contact, however, the Indians had retrogressed to a partial state of barbarism. During the 1860's it was thought that the earliest stone tools in Europe had been made 100,000 to 240,000 years ago, and those from the Somme Valley in France were termed Paleolithic by Lubbock.","Since the men living in Europe at that time hunted animals now extinct, it was anticipated that similar associations would be found in the New World. As a result of searches for these early remains, tools found in gravels near Trenton, New Jersey, were attributed to the Paleolithic, and a human skull from a California gold mine was considered of Pliocene age. This dating was not to endure, and by the turn of the present century a reaction had developed against assuming a great antiquity for New World man. Ales Hrdlicka, a physical anthropologist and archaeologist, spearheaded the attack. From a detailed study of all the reportedly ancient finds he concluded that man had been here only in postglacial times."

When it comes to the number of independent genetic units (language families and isolates 2) the dispute is extremely intense; estimates range from one to nearly 200 (see Chapter 2). The methods for classifying these languages are hotly debated, and even the standard methods employed throughout the history of historical linguistics have frequently been misinterpreted (see Chapters 2 and 7). The typological structure of American Indian languages has been an important factor in the history of their classification; however, opinion has varied from assumptions that there is only one unified structural type, shared by all American languages, which unites them typologically and genetically (including Eskimo-Aleut, socalled Na-Dene, and in some extreme cases even the so-called Paleo-Siberian languages of northeast Asia; see Chapter 2), to opinions that there is greater typological diversity in the Americas than in the rest of the world combined (see Ibarra Grasso 1958:12, McQuown 1955:501). For example, Sapir and Swadesh felt that “it is safe to say that any grammatical category to be found elsewhere in the world is sure to have a near analog somewhere in the native languages of the new world"" (1946:110)."

In Central America, several language communities have simply come to be known in Spanish (the politically dominant language of the region) by whatever names nonIndians apply to them. Tektiteko (Teco, Mayan) speakers were told by schoolteachers and missionaries that they spoke Cakchiquel (Kaqchikel); that is, it was recognized that they did not speak the Mam (a related Mayan language) found in the region, and so arbitrarily someone decided to call it Cakchiquel (Kaqchikel), though true Kaqchikel (a Mayan language from a different subgroup) is spoken rather far from the Tektiteko area.

Another source of confusion, and sometimes of hard feelings, which is the reverse of that just mentioned, is that in a growing number of Native American groups, the preferred selfdesignations, or “native” names, differ from those ingrained in the popular and professional literature. For example, the language that was traditionally termed Papago (and Pima) is now generally called O’odham by its speakers and by those involved with the language. A few other of the many examples of the differences between older, entrenched names and the more recently preferred “native” ethnonyms include “Navajo” (as well as other Athabaskan languages) and “Dine” (with various modifiers); “Costanoan” and “Ohlone”; “Karok” and “Karuk”; “Kwakiutl” and “Kwak'wala”; “Yuma"" and “Quechan”; “Tarascan” and “Phorhépecha”; ""Ocuilteco” and “Tlahuica""; and “Mapuche/ Araucanian” and “Mapudungu.” This conflict poses a problem."

In the wars against the Arawak inhabitants of the Lesser Antilles, able-bodied native men were killed off and Carib men took their place, resulting in a mixed society consisting of Iñeri(Arawak-]speaking women and children and Mainland Carib-speaking men, who used Pidgin Carib to bridge the language gap between them. Children born of these unions learned their mothers’ Arawakan language; the men's Carib failed to be imposed as a community language, but Pidgin Carib continued to be used because these people continued to identify themselves ethnically as Caribs and maintained political and trading relations with Mainland Caribs. Hence, the Pidgin Carib was retained for these functions and became the men's jargon. Media Lengua and Catalangu Carib Pidgin-Arawak Mixed Language Taylor and Hoff (1980) argue that a mixed language involving Carib Pidgin and Arawak is the ancestor of the Island Carib men's language, basically an Arawakan language with a special men's jargon based on Carib lexical items.","Most of what is known about this language is based on forms presented in Raymond Breton's (1665, 1667) works on the Island Carib of Dominica and Saint Vincent (where the language is now extinct) which he designated as “language of men' and 'language of women.' “A few remnants of the male register” (Hoff 1994:161) are also preserved in Garifuna (Black Carib) of Central America, whose speakers are descendants of Island Caribs who were deported from Saint Vincent in 1797 (see Chapters 4 and 5), though most to the men's language is now lost. The Cariban elements of the male jargon are limited to lexical items and one postposition, while the grammatical morphemes of both male and female styles are all of Arawakan origin. Hoff (1994) supports the argument that the Cariban elements in the men's jargon are from the Carib Pidgin and not directly from the mainland Carib language itself.

The number of languages in any given region of North America, however, is hardly a function of time alone. There are a greater number of languages known from the Pacific Northwest and California primarily because it is one of the areas on the continent where indigenous populations weathered the deadly effects of European contact and disease and survived (though in an altered form) at least until the end of the nineteenth century when intensive linguistic fieldwork began in North America. . . ."

Adelung and Vater (1816) discussed similarities they saw between Eyak, Tlingit, and Tanaina (Athabaskan) but interpreted the vocabulary resemblances as the result of borrowing. Radloff (1858) thought that “Eyak might be genetically related to Athapaskan, but also that the considerable vocabulary Eyak shares with Tlingit probably indicates a genetic relationship,” while Buschmann (1856) found “Eyak and Athapaskan related, but Tlingit separate” (both quoted in M.

Sapir (1929a) put Yukian in his Hokan-Siouan group, though his reasoning is unknown. Swadesh (1954b) included Yukian in his Hokogian net (which included Hokan, Muskogean, and several other languages of the Gulf region), but he did not group it with its Californian “Hokan” neighbors but rather with Coahuiltecan and Chitimacha. William Shipley (1957) presented some Yukian lexical similarities with so-called California Penutian languages but left open the question of affinity. Elmendorf (1963) took up the possibility of the Siouan connection suggested by Radin and accommodated by Swadesh; however, his ninety-five sets of lexical similarities, although suggestive, fall far short of supporting a genetic relationship (connecting Yukian and Siouan neither directly with each other nor as members of some more inclusive classification) (see Chapter 8).","in the classification list—which have been identified from colonial and other sources, are generally associated with groups thought to be extinct but nevertheless usually identified as UtoAztecan. These need much more research. The list presented here is far from exhaustive, and the tentative affinities and alternate names here are those given in the sources cited. The names from California are all thought to belong to Takic (though some scholars believe some may have an independent status); these are San Nicolas (Nicoleño); Giamina (Kroeber (1907:153] and Lamb (1964a:110] thought this might be a separate branch of Uto-Aztecan; its status as an independent branch of Northern Uto-Aztecan is uncertain [Miller 19836:122]); and Vanyume (clearly Takic)."

Eight branches at the lower levels are generally recognized (Numic, Takic, Tübatulabal, Hopi, Pimic, Taracahitic, Cora-Huichol, and Aztecan). There is no agreement concerning higher-level groupings. Recent research supports an early branching of the family into two divisions, Northern (including Numic, Takic, Tübatulabal, and Hopi) and Southern (including Pimic, Taracahitic, CoraHuichol, and Aztecan). Also, it now appears that Cora-Huichol and Aztecan are more closely related to each other than to others within the Southern division (see Campbell and Langacker 1978), though several scholars simply consider both Aztecan and Cora-Huichol to be equal in status to the other branches of Southern Uto-Aztecan (or Sonoran, depending on their classification).","Gabrielino (or GabrieleñoFernandeño) is also extinct; it is clearly a Takic language, but it may have been either an independent branch within Takic or more closely aligned with Serrano. Still not universally accepted are the traditional groups of Shoshonean (including at least Numic [Plateau Shoshoni), Takic (Southern California Shoshoni), and sometimes all the Northern languages) and Sonoran (including Pimic, Taracahitic, and CoraHuichol) (see Heath 1977). The most commonly cited reconstruction of the Proto-Uto-Aztecan phonemic inventory is: [p, t, c, k, kW, 2, s, h, m, (n), (î), (), (r), w, y; i, a, i, o, u; vowel length/ (see Kaufman 1981, Langacker 1977:22). The long-running controversy about whether the fifth vowel was *ior *e has now been resolved in favor of ** (Langacker 1970, Campbell and Langacker 1978).

However, by 1690, they had retreated to the Yazoo River in Mississippi, near the Yazoo and Tunica tribes. Record of them was lost for the period between 1784 and 1908; in 1908 John R. Swanton found a single surviving Ofo speaker living among the Tunica in Louisiana, from whom he obtained the extant linguistic material (see Haas 1969e, Swanton 1946:165– 6). When first encountered by French and Spanish explorers, the Biloxi were located on the lower Pascagoula River and Biloxi Bay in Mississippi. They subsequently lived in several locations in Louisiana; some were removed to Texas and Oklahoma (Swanton 1946:96–8).","Both Ofo and Biloxi are now extinct. Voegelin (1939) demonstrated that the two languages are fairly closely related. Tutelo was found near Salem, Virginia, in 1671. From here the Tutelo moved eastward and northward, and in 1714 they were settled with other tribes at Fort Christiana and on the Meherrin River. After peace was made between the Iroquois and the Virginia tribes in 1722, the Tutelo moved northward and settled before 1744 at Shamokin, Pennsylvania, under Iroquois protection."

The early 1700s saw the French involved in several missionizing attempts and several Indian attacks, which culminated in 1731 with the surrender of about 400 Natchez who were sent to the West Indies as slaves; the others scattered throughout the lowlands of the Mississippi. Gradually, some withdrew among the Chickasaw, and others settled among the Upper Creeks. One band reached South Carolina and ultimately united with the Cherokee.","The language became extinct in the 1930s. Attempts to relate Natchez to other languages have been unpersuasive. Swanton (1924) believed it to be related to Muskogean, an opinion shared by Mary Haas (1956) and Kimball (1994).

He compared it to Otopamean languages (Otomanguean family), to some so-called Hokan languages, and to some South American languages, finding that “the few correspondences are distributed almost equally among the three linguistic groups.” Weitlaner concluded that the language belongs to the Uto-Aztecan group (Weitlaner 1948a:217–18). William Bright, on the other hand, thought that Naolan belonged to Hokan-Coahuiltecan, perhaps to be identified with Janambre or Tamaulipec (1955:285); Swadesh also placed it in the HokanCoahuiltecan group, but with closer connections with Tonkawan (1968).

Indications in Weitlaner's discussion suggest equating Naolan with Mazcorros, or (less probably) with Pizones—groups whose names are known in this area from colonial reports. Of Weitlaner's forty-three words and phrases, six are loans from Spanish, five are certain loans from other indigenous languages, and another four are probably also loans (Campbell 1979:948–9). This leaves very little native material to work with, perhaps too little for any reliable proposal of kinship. (16) tGuaicurian (Waikurian)","The Guaicurian languages of Baja California are extinct. The surviving documentation is extremely slight, only translations of the Lord's Prayer, the twelve articles of the Apostles' Creed, a verb paradigm, and a few additional words in Guaicuri itself (recorded by German missionary Johann Jakob Baegert 1952[1771]). The extant linguistic evidence (actually the lack thereof) provides next to no basis for establishing that the languages traditionally assigned to the Guaicurian family are actually related or how they might be subgrouped if they are related. Reasonable inferences have been made based on snatches of information in other historical reports about where these languages were spoken, who used them, and which were most similar. Buschmann (1859) analyzed Baegert's materials and concluded that Guaicuri was both independent of the Yuman languages of Baja California and was different from all the other languages of the region."

These Directions were published in the Philosophical Transactions in three parts during several months of 1665-66, the third, by Robert Boyle, appearing with the title, ""General Heads for a Natural History of a Countrey, Great or Small.""28 And without doubt these Directions did exert an influence on English land and sea travelers."

T. L. Eyerly's (1907) Wolf Creek expedition to examine the “Buried City ruins tested this perception through excavation noting that Indian oral tradition attributed these ruins to the work of the white men. With this initial assessment of racial classification disproven, later studies focused on typological assessments and basic craniometry as a means of tracing population relationships. Archeological context and chronometric dating techniques were recognized as essential information for the interpretation of skeletal specimens as reliance on skeletal form (i.e., morphological dating) proved unreliable as an indicator of antiquity."

Fish moved in the waters—birds nested in the trees—animals were born in the forests. Finally man came, first a dusky complexioned man who made his tools of stone, then white-skinned men from Europe and blackskinned men from Africa who soon peopled the entire continent. Today, on the exposed surface of these glacial and interglacial deposits our busy civilization moves. Beneath our city streets, small towns, and cultivated fields, are the remains of the earlier man.","Under his remains are those of extinct marine creatures that are remnants of the days long ago when southern Delaware was under the sea.

And he emphasizes the strangeness of these spectacles, in which a captive Apache looks at and is looked at by ""captive"" African Americans, women, and Iggorrotes. Geronimo spends the entirety of Geronimo's Story of His Life carefully and eloquently moving toward his final point: he wants his people to be allowed to return to Arizona. His entire oration builds toward this final request, after a book's worth of evidence detailing the crucial associations between the Apaches and their home places, as well as the wrongs that have beset them since their forced removal from those locations. In the final chapter, ""Hopes for the Future,"" he explicitly describes the Apaches as ""prisoners of war,"" warns that their numbers are diminishing because they are being held away from their Arizona homelands, and asserts, ""I want to spend my last days there, and be buried among those mountains.","If this could be I might die in peace, feeling that my people, placed in their native homes, would increase in numbers, rather than diminish as at present, and that our name would not become extinct"" (215).

At first it looked like a buffalo, and then he realized that the creature had tusks. Then he came to a startling conclusion: the animal was a mammoth. His heart beat fast. The primitive artist who had made the drawing of the animal on the shell must have seen a mammoth face to face, Cresson reasoned.","Yet he knew that no man had seen a living mammoth in thousands of years, for the beast had become extinct in the eastern part of America at least twenty or twenty-five thousand years before! Therefore, he concluded, the picture must have been incised on the shell by a member of an ancient race who lived in the Delaware Valley at a time when the mammoth plodded through a forest, of which all that remained was a peat formation under the sod. The peat-the shell-man; all were contemporary according to his deductions. Cresson presently sent the shell pendant to Professor F. W. Putnam, then Curator of the Peabody Museum in Cambridge, along with a detailed report of where it was found. He had read of Putnam and knew that the scientist would welcome any data to prove that stone-age men had lived in the East in glacial times, a point that had not been established."

The lack of time depth accorded to the prehistoric cultures of the Susquehanna Valley by Moorehead is indicative of the general problems many American archaeologists were having in the early 20th century.

However, this problem was not restricted to the archaeologists in Eastern North America and given the controversies over the earliest Early Man sites in North America discussed in the archaeological literature of the 1980's, it is safe to say that the same problems linger to the present day. Because there was a limited appreciation of the time depth present in the Susquehanna Valley, the interpretations of the varied artifact assemblages were couched in terms of ethnic groups.

In an attempt to do further study on Koch's collection from Missouri a search was made by Hugo Gross, a German scholar, in 1951. Gross located the bones and what he believed were several of the projectile points, four of which were labeled “Missouri Koch,” which were thought to equate well with the Archaic Culture in Missouri. Another point labeled “Gasconade County, Missouri” is considered a good illustration of the Dalton point, a type that has been dated at 7850 B.C., plus or minus 500 years.8 The Koch discoveries, if honestly reported, lend supporting evidence to the belief that early man lived contemporaneous with Ice Age mammals."

Relative and absolute dating methods are based upon changes that occur in constituents of either organic or inorganic components of bone through time.

Chemical methods of dating bone measure the proportions of certain stable elements or compounds—such as fluoride, uranium, or nitrogen—within the bone which are lost or gained during the period of burial as a means of determining relative age. Because environmental factors, which often are variable between localities, affect rates of chemical changes within bone, at present only relative rather than absolute dating is possible with chemical dating methods (Berger and Protsch 1991:252-257; Goffer 1980:287-288; Schiffer 1987:184-185; Tite 1972:66-67, 150).","Fluoride, uranium, and nitrogen analyses often have been used to solve problems regarding the contemporaneity of human skeletal remains and extinct fauna found in association.

Like nitrogen dating, the measurement of remaining fat was based on the gradual, progressive loss of this organic component by deteriorating bone, with fat remaining in bones for several thousand years. This method of relative dating, though not precise, appears to have yielded results comparable to those obtained by fluoride analysis (Goffer 1980:292).

One of Oakley's earliest investigations, conducted with L. S. B. Leakey and H. J. Walls, was the fluoride analysis of bones and teeth from Kenya.

Although surely a projective fantasy, like other stories collated into folklore collections this specimen of Yellowstone National Park fakelore has been accepted uncritically as a valid “legend” of the Northwest (Salmonson 1995:123–140).

In the foregoing depiction of Sheep Eaters, Chittenden also managed to introduce the second misconception that they were fearful and dimwitted. After Chittenden it was not uncommon to hear Yellowstone National Park and non-park commentators refer to the Sheep Eaters as “a weak and degenerate race, wholly unfitted to hold their own” (Phillips 1927:32). Well acquainted with the park's interpretative programs over the years, Yellowstone veteran Paul Schullery recently summarized these Chittenden-instigated notions of Sheep Eater mental competence and the presumed degree of weakened fortitude which derived from because they simply couldn't survive anyplace else [Schullery 1997:24].","Well into the present century one continued to hear this characterization of Sheep Eaters as excessively shy and retiring, with Nedward M.

Coupled with their alleged mental inferiority, this belief led to the conclusion that Sheep Eaters were unable to defend themselves. Again, the subtext of this characterization seems to have been a sort of highly dubious equivalence between pugnacity and heightened brain-power. Yet even favorable assessments of the Sheep Eaters have accepted this equivalence, as Sarah Olden writes, “This band [of Sheep Eaters] was more intelligent, and very warlike” (Olden 1923:13). While Olden offers no documentation for her declaration, Åke Hultkrantz turned up an older discussion of Sheep Eater mental capacity from a Middle Oregon Indian agent named R. R.

When a fairly implausible rumor of possible Crow raids in the Gallatin and Yellowstone valleys reached James Stuart, for instance, he seized the opportunity to advocate no quarter, “I would like it better if it was a fight from the start; we would then kill every Crow that we saw, take the chances of their rubbing us out” (quoted in Haines 1974:63). At almost the same time a fabricated story in the Helena Daily Herald already referred to earlier, reporting the slaughter of 18 Indians at the Falls of the Yellowstone, revealed the tenor of the times.

Research suggests that the increased aluminum content in soils north of Georgian Bay, believed to have been caused by acid rain, is preventing germination of seeds of some forest species. The effects of acid rain on soil include the dissolving of essential plant nutrients, the destruction of nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with legume crops, the killing of earthworms and the urging of fungi growth causing stem rot and other plant diseases."

In the meantime, field linguists were under pressure to keep up with ever changing theoretical developments, rather than to concentrate on the urgent primary task of documenting the languages of the world. Willem Adelaar argues against the Saussurian concept that languages represent systems of interrelated elements which cannot be removed or altered without affecting the system as a whole. It dictates that language descriptions must be devoid of historical considerations, as these would distort the synchronic equilibrium of the systems that are presented. Much like Pérez Jimenez and Jansen and like López, Adelaar also sees how language death and language shift became legitimate topics of research of considerable theoretical relevance, rather than unwanted developments that had to be stopped."

In sum, there is no empirical evidence for the inference of large game hunting emphasis to the exclusion of most other resources among regional Paleoindians. Thus, the question of whether Paleoindians were ""focal"" or ""diffuse,"" emphasizing large game or a broad spectrum of food resources, is still unresolved in the far Northeast.

A peculiar feature with each burial, was that each lay on a bed of charcoal. It seems evident that a sacrificial or ceremonial fire had been kindled in each grave before the body was entered. From an old newspaper clipping, a Professor of Lawrence (University, Appleton, Wisconsin) took most of these choice pieces with him to be placed in that institution for exhibition. The identification of the mastodon bone (mentioned in paragraph number 3 of the above quotation) is clearly in error.","Because mastodons had become extinct at least 10,000 years before this Middle Historic Period burial, it is extremely unlikely that mastodon bone would have been available in any form. Most likely, the large bone segment was part of a leg bone from a bison, cow, horse or other equally large animal. Efforts to trace this artifact have so far been fruitless.

Sir Henry Yule, in one of his learned notes to Marco Polo, mentions instances which show the connection between cannibalism and sundry folk-lore notions; e.g. “after an execution at Peking certain large pith balls are steeped in the blood, and under the name of blood-bread are sold as a medicine for consumption. It is only to the blood of decapitated criminals that any such healing power is attributed.”","There is evidence that this remnant of cannibalism is not yet extinct in China. Among civilized peoples in modern times instances of cannibalism have been for the most part confined to shipwrecked crews in the last stages of famine. Among savages and barbarians of low type, famine and folk-lore probably combine to support the custom. When the life of the Jesuit priest Brébeuf had gone out amid diabolical torments, during which he had uttered neither cry nor groan, an Iroquois chief tore out his heart and devoured it for the very practical purpose of acquiring all that courage; on the other hand, when one of Mr. Darwin's party asked some Fuegians why they did not eat their dogs instead of their grandmothers, they replied, probably in some amusement at his ignorance of sound economical principles, “Doggies catch otters; old women no l’” In mediaeval Europe instances of cannibalism can be traced to scarcity of food, and among the Turks there seem to have been cases quite sufficient to explain the fabulous picture of King Richard, in the presence of Saladin's ambassadors, dining on a curried Saracen's head “soden full hastily With powder and with spysory, And with saffron of good colour.”"
