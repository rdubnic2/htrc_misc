It is a natural setup for Reichek, who does them as well as those earlier women did, but deliberately reengages them in her study of ethnography. Reichek doesn't think to farm the work out to genteel ladies for authenticity, she does it with authenticity herself. But by adding to her samplers phrases and images she takes from elsewhere, she subverts them and makes them go out of doors. When she includes the words of Indians it isn't to give those people a voice but to make the samplers talk sass to ethnography—after all, these embroideries themselves must surely appear in some ethnographic study or another.","Back in the ""frontier"" days, European women were sometimes captured by Indian groups. Most often they had no wish to return to white society. Reichek rescues these samplers in the same way. Although the samplers do not speak directly to photography, as the knitting does, I imagine that they do because Reichek seems to have taken photography-asknowledge as her special adversary. The photograph is too quick to involve much knowledge, she says.",1992

He discusses the Indian Department, personnel within the War Department appointed to deal with Indians and enforce the Intercourse Acts, the creation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the War Department in 1824, and the establishment of a definitive organization in 1834. He looks at fur trade regulations, an essential element in federal Indian policy, the origin of the factory system in 1796, its purpose, the failure of the trading houses, and the problems of enforcing laws to prevent the use of liquor by traders among Indians. He examines the problems of removing intruders from Indian lands, particularly the settlers' lawless encroachment on Cherokee lands in Tennessee and other areas, provisions in Indian Intercourse Acts for regularizing criminal court procedures in cases arising between natives and white citizens, and tells of the lack of punishment of whites who committed crimes against Indians. The author discusses federal programs of ""civilizing” Indians by promoting agricultural pursuits, educating children, and removing Indians beyond contact with whites to a permanent reservation west of the Mississippi, focusing on the Cherokees and their removal from Georgia.",1983

Indian Agent issued this notice ... to intruders.944 Unwittingly, Price had identified the underlying reason for unlawful intrusions on the reservation: the intruders simply did not regard the Osage ownership of the land as viable or federal protection as likely to be lasting. Certainly the large number of trespassers successfully flouting the law, and Washington's reluctance to use troops to remove them when the military was obviously the only force possessing the strength and authority to do the job, only encouraged persistent and repeated trespass.

The agent, Frank Frantz, counted it a great victory when the Indian police and his staff managed to collect $4,137 in permit taxes at the rate of one dollar a month after tedious and time-consuming exertion. Since Frantz's own observations placed the reservation's white population at between ten and fifteen thousand, using the most conservative figure of his estimate the collection should have totaled $120,000.45 Many Osages had ceased worrying about a situation that now seemed inevitable and tried to make the best of bad circumstances.

The case upheld the constitutionality of the Major Crimes Act passed by Congress in 1885, which placed serious offenses involving reservation Indians as perpetrators and victims wholly within the federal court system. In their reasoning the justices noted that United States territorial governments owed their existence to federal statutes and thus were subject to congressional modifications in the exercise of their powers. Since Indian tribes were legally regarded as wards of the federal government and were not citizens of states or territories, tribal peoples “owe no allegiance to the States, and receive from them no protection.

Large numgers of carijos (servants) were present in the south, sometimes classified as 'administered Indians' but in practice used in a servile status.124 In the Spanish Empire and the independent republics established therefrom, slavery or semi-slavery also continued from the late seventeenth through the nineteenth century in spite of laws prohibiting such.","Along the northern frontier of Mexico slavery continued during the 1690s and persisted until the 1860s, primarily involving Apaches, Navajos, Paiutes, Yavapais, and other border nations whose resistance made them subject to being captured. Some natives from this region were shipped to the West Indies while others (such as the Yaqui in the 1880s) were sold to Yucatan. After the abortive Tupak Amaru rebellion in Peru in 1781-3, however, the Inca nobility suspected of disloyalty to Spain were 'executed, imprisoned, or shipped to exile in Spanish Sahara'. Thus some Americans reached still another part of Africa.125 It should also be noted that when the Spaniards first began bringing slaves and workers from Spain to the West Indies a number of those transported were ladino (Spanish speaking) or of mixed brown appearance. In 1501, for example, Andres Garcia de color loro, formerly a servant and Cristobal de Palacios, de color lor o and a resident of Trigueros, went to Haiti under four-year contracts.",1993

(Later, of course, more Spanish-speaking women were introduced with a resultant 'lightening' of the upper levels among the early mestizos.) To the demographics must be added another compelling motive for AfricanAfrican mixture: freedom. This motive caused great numbers of negros to flee to American areas but it also may have caused many males to have children by free American women so that the said children would be free (and also, perhaps, could eventually purchase their father's freedom). As already discussed, many Americans were liberated from formal slavery after 1542 and, thereafter, most American women were technically free persons.","A few years passed before this reform was effectively implemented (and it was violated in frontier zones continuously). Nonetheless, the child of a Native woman and a Black African slave was a free person after 1542-50, whereas the child of Spaniard and a Black African slave woman was still a slave. It is this free status of the RedBlack mulatto that Viceroy Enriquez wished to have abolished in 1574 (however, the king failed to enact such a decree). In point of fact, some Africans may have been able to obtain freedom for themselves directly by marrying a free American woman. The ancient code of Alfonso the Wise allowed for such a means of emancipation until 1526 when the king specifically closed off that avenue.",1993

Scott Fitzgerald speculate in the concluding scene of The Great Gatsby. Surely, to travel, to see, to name, and to tell are almost inevitable actions in writing. And these actions were just as essential to the early Dutch immigrants with whom Carraway identifies, to the conquistadors (or with the Indians, the discovered seeing the discoverers) imagined by Williams, and to later Anglo-Americans who came West (or in the case of the Spanish, who went north) for religious and economic conquest and settlement as they were to Fergusson.","Indeed, Fergusson was a native-born granddaughter of a Santa Fe trader, daughter of a frontier attorney and territorial representative to Congress, a “native” Anglo-American observer and commentator who came to be known among certain Indian peoples as Beautiful Swift Fox.

In Fender's scheme the explosion of travel accounts during the great trek to the California gold fields was but a realization of Tocqueville's and Emerson's prophecies that conventional fictions would, in effect, fall away in the face of the capacity of the American landscape to create wonderment. Faced with the sublimity of landscape and the comparative strangeness of the flora and fauna in the West, the American travel writer would be regenerated, reborn, although somewhat anxiously, out of the kind of wilderness adventure, the kind of primitivism which America offered.

Murder and Mystery is clearly a work of regional literature which focuses on several communities and subregions within New Mexico, and this explains, in part, why Knopf-when first presented in the early forties with the idea for a book of several spine-chilling and bizarre New Mexico murders and thinking it too quaintly local-turned it down. But unlike Albuquerque it ranges far and wide across New Mexico and reads more like a series of detective or mystery tales than it does as a travel book, notwithstanding the amount of travel and interviewing Fergusson had to do in compiling her information.

Subsequently, when General Anthony Wayne defeated the same Indian confederacy that had earlier routed St. Clair's army, he brought along and utilized as scouts and light infantrymen a contingent of Chickasaw and Choctaw warriors.50 Between 1790 and 1861, extensive use of troops supplied by allied Indian nations was made against other Native Americans.

This medium became the message, and the criteria of values and the virtues of hard work were voiced abroad as the principles of true Americanism. But the Depression belied the gospel of hard work because it presented an irrational aspect to the smooth functioning of the free enterprise system.

This basic sovereignty lasted into the closing years of the last century. From the late 1880s until 1934, self-government of Indian tribes was held in limbo as the federal government exercised complete control over the lives and property of Indian people. Such activity was thought to be justified by the outbreaks inspired by Indian religious prophets in the 1890s, which resulted in the Ghost Dance and the Wounded Knee Massacre. Thus every effort was made to destroy Indian culture in order to break the hold of the tribe over individual Indians.","It was thought that in this manner peace and quiet would be brought to the frontier. Indian children were kidnapped and taken thousands of miles away to government boarding schools. Once there, they were whipped if they used their native languages or made any references to their former mode of life. All religious ceremonies were banned on Indian reservations. Priceless objects of art were destroyed on the advice of missionaries and bureaucrats because these were thought to be manifestations of the old pagan way of life.",1974

Isleta, the “island” pueblo, is rich in comparative Native American/Hispanic/Anglo cultures.

And the point could even be extended to say that Fergusson's Rio Grande probably influenced Horgan's other histories and biographies such as ""About the Southwest: A Panorama of Nueva Granada,” published in the Southwest Review in 1933, just two years after the first installment of Rio Grande appeared in The American Mercury in May 1931, as well as From the Royal City (1936), The Centuries of Santa Fe (1956), Lamy of Santa Fe (1975), and Josiah Gregg and His Vision of the Early West (1979). Echoes of Harvey Fergusson's Rio Grande can also be heard in Erna Fergusson's books on New Mexico, including Dancing Gods (1931, although the influence here seems reciprocal), Our Southwest (1940), Albuquerque (1947), Murder and Mystery in New Mexico (1948), and New Mexico: A Pageant of Three Peoples (1951).

It rests, for what validity it has, on the custom whereby the missionaries, as the legal guardians of their wards, imposed a form of corporal punishment on the badly behaved, a practice that had been followed in the missions of Spanish America for two centuries. Because a brief explanation of these punishments would be misleading, and because a detailed treatment would be impossible, let us limit ourselves to a few observations which will preclude the necessity of describing mission discipline. First of all, the colonization of Upper California was the most elaborate and expensive operation attempted by the Spanish government in North America since the sixteenth century. Hence, partially to avoid excessive cost and partially to insure her hold on the California coast, Spain wanted to maintain peace with the Indians.","Outrage of or offense to the large Indian population between San Diego and San Francisco might easily touch off a frontier war that would threaten Spanish security in that area. The Chumash Indians alone, between Ventura and San Luis Obispo, have recently been said to have numbered 15,000 people. And the presidial force of the Spanish, especially in the early years of colonization, were undermanned and often ill equipped. Governor Felipe de Neve (1777-1782) was always careful to be generous with gifts to the Indians and never to let them know how many troops he had at his disposal. But if the missionaries had been commonly brutal and cruel to their neophytes, and if the Indians, in their culture, had been accustomed to avenge injury with death, would not the danger of war have been greatly and needlessly increased?",1987

Foreign settlers did not always choose to become good Mexican citizens, as for example the Anglo-Texans who refused to set their slaves free or to obey Mexican land-title and tariff regulations. The early Mexican governments were often beset by financial difficulties and progress was difficult in the face of widespread illiteracy and an unequal distribution of wealth and power. Gradually, however, these negative conditions were overcome and the Mexican people advanced along the road of democracy, albeit with backward steps from time to time.

During the unsettled years of the American Revolution, the westward expansion of Canadian settlement was negligible, but after 178o most of southern Ontario was acquired through haphazard negotiation, usually to acquire lands for a specific group, such as retired soldiers, United Empire Loyalists, groups migrating from the British Isles, and in some cases for resettling other Indians. The discovery of minerals on the shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior accelerated what had been a leisurely and haphazard process, and in two treaties consummated in 1850, the so-called Robinson Treaties, title was acquired from the Ojibwa Indians to all the lands along the north shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior and northward to the boundaries of the Hudson's Bay Company territory.

In the South, where a feudal society did develop, extensive miscegenation occurred, both with African and Indian servants; (3) Calvinism, with its antagonism toward all foreign cultures, tended to erect a wall between European and American.

Still rankling over the loss of their colonies and resenting bitterly the acquisition of Louisiana by Jefferson, the British imperialists were determined to throttle, if possible, the growing American trade, so that they naturally looked upon the Indians of the United States as prospective allies to be prepared in every way possible against the eventuality of another war.",1931

Accordingly, after having committed the powerful and warlike Dakotas and other great tribes in the far west to his confederacy, leaving his affairs in Ohio in the hands of the Prophet, he proceeded to Georgia, establishing his new base among the Creeks among whom, by reason of his mother's blood, his influence was compelling. Yet, among the Cherokees, and the Chicasaws who were confederated with them, and the Choctaws he seems to have made little headway against Ross who continued to urge them to hold aloof from him. At any rate, as it turned out, his visit to the South was a fatal mistake. Unfortunately for the success of his plans, the Prophet, who was not a statesman, consumed with selfimportance, soon after Tecumseh's departure from Ohio, allowed several hundred Shawnees to assemble around him which seemed to indicate no other purpose on their part than war.","The cry for aid which arose at once from the frontier could not be ignored by Madison. Therefore, he despatched to Ohio a force under Gen. William Henry Harrison who was instructed to bring on the issue at once and crush the western tribes so thoroughly that they would be unable to aid the British. The southern tribes could be cared for later. The evidence is convincing that the Indians under the Prophet until now had not the slightest idea of taking to the warpath until ordered to do so by Tecumseh, but as Harrison's force approached the inevitable occurred.
